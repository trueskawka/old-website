  <li>check-out</li>
  <li>coursework on algorithms and effective thinking</li>
  <li>signed-up to facilitate interview prep</li>
</ul>

<p>Focusing on my Outreachy application, I’ve managed to understand Vagrant better and fix my local Zulip instance with Cihan’s help. And when I say fix, I mean solve a problem that didn’t exist, since my codebase has not been updated to the latest version and there were some problems that shouldn’t be there. We’ve also managed to rebase Michael’s branch locally. And by rebasing I mean making it work with his changes while they’re not working.</p>

<p>During the check-out I’ve talked mostly about redoing my RC jobs profile yesterday and problems with Vagrant. Comparing it to Brian’s and Jonathan’s work on their apps and Deniz’s progress with d3.js, I feel like it was an easy way out of the accountability of check-outs.</p>

<p>Apart from struggles with making things work, reading up about new companies for Outreachy and preparing to facilitate interview prep (because, obviously, I feel ill-equipped to test other people on their programming skills), I’ve done some progress on the algorithms and effective thinking courses. As a good starting point for ideas to hopefully come, here are the five elements of effective thinking (which sound a lot like steps for learning anything):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>understand deeply</strong></p>

    <p>Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. There are degrees to understanding and you can always heighten yours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>make mistakes</strong></p>

    <p>Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>raise questions</strong></p>

    <p>Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>follow ideas</strong></p>

    <p>Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>change</strong></p>

    <p>You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of learning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>read up on Zulip documentation, roadmap and issues</li>
  <li>had a fruitful conversation with Sumana on Outreachy</li>
  <li>set up a meeting with Michael on his Zulip feature</li>
  <li>planned next steps</li>
  <li>check-out</li>
  <li>started a course in effective thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>As I work towards the Outreachy internship, I get more and more comfortable with thinking about the big projects and tackling them in small chunks. I’ve reread a big part of Zulip documentation, studied the roadmap and current issues, trying to figure out where my skills and expectations would fit best.</p>

<p>Sumana is a knowledgable, skillful and amazing person. I’ve spent with her only 1.5 hours today and not only did she help me with my Outreachy ideas and priorities, pointing out some areas my skills could be best used for, but also gave a ton of inspiration on how to grow. I’ve been getting more and more inspired thanks to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana">Sumana’s blog</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ballingt.com/">Tom’s work</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://moriel.smarterthanthat.com/tips/the-language-double-take-dealing-with-bidirectional-text-or-wait-tahw/">Moriel’s take on RTL language support</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also think that, given my experience and skills, building features for right-to-left language support and other internationalization aspects of apps sounds like a good project to focus on, while also remembering that I want to work on more than one area, since multiple goals are more likely to help me grow.</p>

<p>Michael, an RC alumnus, build a stream filtering feature for Zulip and I’m meeting with him on Thursday to understand it better and be able to work on it, as to merge it with the codebase. There is also an interesting feature for counting users following a stream and I’ll look into it tomorrow, to see what I’ll need help with.</p>

<p>One of the next steps in the application process is to learn how to use Vagrant properly - at the moment I’m mostly running commands I don’t fully understand, which doesn’t help with troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Second day of check-outs worked well. The group got a little big bigger, though considering the format a 25% increase is pretty substantial and I’d say 5 people is really the limit if it’s going to work as a method for improving accountability. The more people in the group, the less engaged they are and I think engagement is the key. Same as yesterday, others have done so much I’m motivated to do more for tomorrow’s meeting.</p>

<p>Just to have some entertainment that doesn’t feel like wasting much time, I’ve started a course on <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.9.10x+3T2016/">Effective Thinking through Mathematics</a>. Improving analytical skills is always useful and I need a break from time to time.</p>

<p>Also, the best quote I’ve stumbled upon today, thanks to <a href="http://rose.github.io/posts/measured-in-wats/">Rose</a>: <em>knowledge is power - it’s measured in wats</em>.</p>

          <p>Achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>had a chat about Outreachy</li>
  <li>implemented users in the Sinatra app</li>
  <li>learned something about the edit distance problem</li>
  <li>first check-out</li>
</ul>

<p>The new apartment is great, but I didn’t anticipate how long it would take to get to RC in the morning. I was late for my check-in and office hours for Outreachy at Zulip. Thankfully, I’ve managed to ask the questions I’ve needed answers for and decided what contribution to start with.</p>

<p>That being said, I’ve not worked much on Zulip today, as I paired with Michelle on Sinatra user authentication and managed to implement users in the to-do app, as a next step for learning how to build the main app. I’ve also learned how to solve the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/">edit distance</a> problem from Joe, though I haven’t implemented it myself yet, so that could be a good exercise sometime soon.</p>

<p>I’ve also had my first check-out, best described as a check-in at the end of the day, but not as casual. Together with Deniz, Brian and Noah we discussed what we’ve done today and showed the actual code, which is the first time I’ve done it apart from pairing in a long time. Tomorrow we meet again at 6pm to review our progress, which is very motivating, considering how much they’ve all managed to do today.</p>

<p>In order not to be so out of sync I’ve decided to pull another all-nighter. My reasoning was to get so tired, I’ll have to go to sleep at a reasonable hour to get up early on Monday. And I won’t be late for the Museum of Natural History trip. It all went great most of the day, but now I’m too tired to go to the new apartment and sleep.</p>

<p>Apart from the trip and switching apartment for the next two weeks, I’ve had some quality time with RC friends and managed to play with a few Markdown tools, to get a better feeling for my app. I also read another book on Sinatra, but still require some pairing from a more experienced developer to set it up right.</p>

<p>New week, greater challenges!</p>

<ul>
  <li>porozmawiałam z Andym o pomysłach i funkcjonalnościach mojej aplikacji Mardownowej</li>
  <li>zaczęłam się uczyć Emacsa</li>
  <li>zrobiłam kilka tutoriali w Sinatrze</li>
</ul>

<p>Dzisiaj skupiłam się przede wszystkim na planowaniu mojej aplikacji Markdownowej i szukaniu inspiracji. Długa rozmowa z Andym pomogła w zdefiniowaniu podstawowych i przydatnych funkcjonalności, wraz z wieloma innymi świetnymi pomysłami. Doszliśmy do wniosku, że istnieje tutaj pewne szczególne uczucie - “kocham Cię w duchu RC” - platonicznej więzi i współdzielenia radości ze wspólnej pracy i działania (po polsku brzmi to co najmniej jak swego rodzaju propaganda).</p>

<p>Poza ściągnięciem 12 nowych narzędzi Markdownowych i pobawienia się nimi, zaczęłam się uczyć Emacsa (edytor dla ‘prawdziwych programistów’) i postanowiłam przez kolejny tydzień pisać kod tylko przy jego pomocy, żeby sprawdzić, czemu wszyscy tak go chwalą. Pod koniec tygodnia będę miała wypracowane świadome zdanie na ten temat i poczuję się lepiej, niezależnie od tego, na co się ostatecznie zdecyduję.</p>

<p>Przerobiłam też kilka tutoriali do Sinatry dla potwierdzania tożsamości użytkowników, chociaż nadal nie czuję, że dobrze je rozumiem i potrafię używać.</p>

</ul>

<p>I didn’t suspect that becoming a full-time night-owl can be so satisfying and at the same time so completely out of sync with everyone. I sleep and rest better, but anything happening before noon is out of my reach.</p>

<p>The RC part of the day started late, with some much needed personal errands that took priority over interview prep, watercolours and blog meeting. Thankfully, at least I’ve made it to Mike’s second Wireshark workshop and was able to sign-up for Paul’s intense workshop on entrepreneurship next Saturday.</p>

<p>I wanted to simply refactor one of my old projects, but got inspired to come up with an app for RC community - a pop quiz to help learn fellow Recursers’ names. In order to do that with a minimum setup, I’ve decided to use Ruby and Sinatra, which I first had to learn.</p>

<p>A few hours, one <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/just-do-it-learn-sinatra-i/">pretty good tutorial</a> and some hundred Google queries later, I’ve created and deployed a <a href="https://initialist.herokuapp.com/">simple to-do list</a> app on Heroku. At the moment there are no users, so I’m not taking responsibility for any content that may or may not be added by any third parties. Over the weekend I’ll add some users and authorisation, probably using the RC OAuth, just to practice before the bigger project.</p>

<p>In case anyone wants to try the tutorial (the app is 95% the tutorial verbatim with some CSS flavours on top), it took me some time to figure out how to deploy it to Heroku. Most helpful tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an empty postgresql database must be initiated:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>migratons happen in heroku console:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>heroku run console
require 'sinatra'
require 'slim'
require 'data_mapper'
require './main'
DataMapper.setup(:default, ENV['DATABASE_URL'] ||

  <li>seen community presentations</li>
  <li>took part in game night</li>
  <li>refactored an old project</li>
</ul>

<p>We officially outdid ourselves - got so lost in work, at some point we’ve realized that it’s already 6am and we should get some breakfast. My first time at a diner consisted of three huge French toasts with syrup, something to keep one full for the next 10 hours. After a quick trip to the apartment, I got back to RC to work on my Outreachy application and presentation. I’ll try to write a longer post on the latter, as soon as I figure out what’s the best way of rendering mathematical formulas in HTML.</p>

<p>The community presentations today were fun, some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fenimore’s <a href="https://github.com/polypmer/barnacle">Music Server</a> for streaming albums over local network (also, his music preferences seem interesting enough to dig into it just for the sake of listening to something new)</li>
  <li>Harold’s <a href="https://epub.press/">EpubPress</a> Chrome extension for turning web content into ebooks</li>
  <li>Noah’s <a href="https://twitter.com/TinyDungeons">Tiny Dungeon Twitter Bot</a> and what’s even more amazing - someone was inspired to create a <a href="http://tdp.andrewfaraday.com/">Dungeon Player</a> out of the tweets</li>
</ul>

<p>The game night was pretty intense - there were so many new people, including a lot of alumni, that after playing a short game of Codenames and my first Go game ever (thank you Danielle!), I grabbed a pizza slice and beer to work quietly in a side room. This week has been a bit overwhelming and I felt like working on refactoring some old projects.</p>

<p>I’ve managed to work mostly on one of them, a tiny weather app. I first fixed the <a href="https://codepen.io/trueskawka/pen/pgdvdY">old implementation</a> and went on to work on the <a href="https://trueskawka.github.io/weather">new one</a> for about two hours. I’ve encountered some little bugs, two that might be useful for future reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chrome doesn’t accept anymore geolocation over insecure connections - easily fixed with <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code></li>
  <li>the OpenWeatherMap.org has a secure API as a premium feature - after reading up about possible solutions (e.g. getting data from other sources, <a href="http://freegeoip.net/json/">IP-based</a>), I’ve decided to simply use <a href="https://crossorigin.me/">crossorigin.me</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also wanted to learn something new and decided <a href="https://css-tricks.com/animating-svg-css/">animating SVG</a> sounds fun enough. All in all, with a few more projects to refactor, I feel pretty comfortable with tackling them over the next week or so.</p>

<ul>
  <li>got comfortable with Outreachy application process and narrowed down my choices to three companies</li>
  <li>got a working Zulip development environment</li>
  <li>productively procrastinated on a presentation</li>
  <li>went for a feelings check-in</li>
  <li>visited Eva and Shawn</li>
  <li>signed up for a blog club and interview prep</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel I’ve finally read enough about the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy">Outreachy</a> application process to feel comfortable with applying. I’ve reached out on Zulip to Sumana (experienced Outreachy mentor) and the thread helped me tremendously, especially when Alice shared her application experiences. I’ll focus on trying out the projects I’m interested in locally (or reading up about the ones that are not strictly technical), maybe even make small contributions over the weekend.</p>

<p>Instead of simply procrastinating, I’ve managed to focus on science behind making decisions and quitting, inspired by an <a href="https://medium.com/galleys/optimal-stopping-45c54da6d8d0#.txu450qhe">article on optimal stopping</a>. I have some slides for tomorrow, but I’m not yet sure if I’m going to present - it’s not entirely a technical topic. Though knowing when to quit a project seems like a useful skill for Recursers.</p>

<p>The feelings check-in was a blast. It’s interesting how hearing about insecurities of others helps with my own struggles.</p>

<p>I visited the always warm and welcoming Eva and Shawn. The baby is going to be born soon, can’t wait! Also, I might give back to my American family and help out with some web development in exchange for dinner and cheesecake.</p>

<p>Friday is going to be a busy day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interview prep - I’ve been a bit late for prep signups, so instead of algorithms I’m just going to do regular interview questions</li>
  <li>watercolours - I’ll spend some time with Nayley on the pure pleasure of playing with paints</li>
  <li>blog club - we’re starting a new group at RC, encouraging each other to write more and/or better blog posts</li>

</ul>

<p>I think it was high time to stop kidding myself - I am not nor will I ever be a morning person. Starting the day slowly and getting to RC just in time for my breakfast and 1pm check-in was the perfect solution to my motivation problems. Firstly, I got so much sleep I woke up without an alarm and wasn’t stressed about being late. Coming in during the day, seeing all those people working away on their laptops, focused, calm and going forward with their plans was my driving force for today.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mike, warmups are alive and well again, and I’ve had a nice half hour playing with a simple problem in Python.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to plan my Markdown app - the features I want to include, people to ask for help and pair with, general look and feel of it. I’ve asked Marcio for some help on getting started and will hopefully pair soon with Nick (macOS development), Andy (macOS development and Markdown) and Michelle (Markdown filtering). Can’t wait!</p>

<p>As for minor tweaks, I’ve spent a productive half-hour learning all the Gmail shortcuts. I have so many messages coming in every day, it’s surprising I’ve never done that before.</p>

<p>Cihan made it in time for code dojo and we’ve created together a working simple solution in Python and then struggled to reimplement it in Elm. About an hour after the dojo ended, a simplistic approach got <a href="https://gist.github.com/trueskawka/ba9f5dae3fd89a30b30a353b30ffee74">implemented</a>. I want to work more on my functional programming, since doing even the simplest things is such a struggle. It’s like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0">relearning to ride a bike</a>.</p>

<p>The improvisation night was so amazing it’s hard to describe. Sarah is such a wonderful teacher! We’ve had a lot of group and individual exercises, all of them focused on supporting each other no matter what. Improv is really about saying “yes and” to everything, I want to do more of that in programming. And a lot more improv. It could’ve also been the group - it’s not often you come up with a new theory for global warming: flying unicorns pooping ice-cream into the atmosphere (that was a very inside joke, no worries if it wasn’t clear).</p>

<p>After the improv I went for great (and very cheap!) vegetarian food with some of my RC friends. It was firstly about bidding farewell to Naomi, but mostly it was simply an amazing evening.</p>

<p>Lastly, some food for thought:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/%EF%B8%8F-write-it-anyway-f31f3ebed5e4#.f4oxuing1">write it</a> anyway</li>

  <li>are you a <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/40/learning/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-jerk">jerk</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>I seem overly amazingly and wonderfully happy recently, I should work on my adjectives starting tomorrow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>met a ton of new people today</li>
  <li>watched community presentations</li>
  <li>lost and regained a friend</li>
  <li>did a mob coding session</li>
  <li>watched presidential debate with friends</li>
  <li>had a lot of quality time</li>
</ul>

<p>Today was the first day of the Fall 2 2016 batch. It was amazing to meet all those new people, ready for their RC experience. It also told us a lot about our first day - we were as utterly lost and confused as we thought we were. I hope our batch can be as great guides for the newcomers, as Summer 2s were for us.</p>

<p>I had a friendship scare today - there was a serious risk of Cihan going back home and I actually thought it’s going to happen most of the day. I wasn’t surprised it moved me - after all, he’s one of my best friends here and it was so sudden, I expected to have six more weeks of coding and bonding. Fortunately, it turned out to be ‘only’ a scare, that got me to also bond with a lot of people. It’s surprising how close one can get to a person in such a short time.</p>

<p>Despite the sadness, I’ve managed to have a pretty cool mob coding session with Sarah, Leah, James and Chris. We build together a working implementation of <a href="https://gist.github.com/trueskawka/8667b12d4552c4ca46b6f79fb195c78d">Hangman</a> in about half an hour (mostly thanks to the mad skills of the Python experts in the group). It was fun, next time we could focus more on actual pairing and not ‘mob coding’ as such - we did a lot of thinking together and it was a bit chaotic. Looking forward to work on that.</p>

<p>Today was an unusual Monday, because we’ve had some presentations. As there were only five of them, I think it’s just appropriate to mention them all:</p>

<ul>
  <li>V talked about <a href="http://vaibhavsagar.com/duffer/">duffer</a> - his implementation of git in Haskell</li>
  <li>Marcio did a short introduction for his <a href="https://github.com/marciok/SwiftyRuby">SwiftyRuby</a> - a way to use Ruby in Swift</li>
  <li>Andy, as hilarious as always, talked about <a href="http://www.simplyshredded.com/oak-roots-how-arnold-turned-his-biggest-weakness%C2%97-his-calves-into-a-showcase-muscle.html">Schwarzenegger’s calfs</a>, in the context of his programming pop-quiz project</li>
  <li>Michelle presented her awesome <a href="http://i17on.com/">intranationalization engine</a> in Markdown and I want to pair with her on my app project, right after I pair with Nick</li>
  <li>Satabdi live coded <a href="https://github.com/satabdidas/RC_Notes/blob/65121c40b26e84a77ddc1c980e2829e9e838ad95/notes/quest_of_deep_c/tiny_elf_execs.md">tiny ELF executables</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After all the events and talks, we all needed some alone time. At 9pm we watched the presidential debate in a side room, as to not make an official event out of it - after all politics can be a bit overwhelming for the community. It was great to see reactions of my friends, especially American ones, who do understand a lot more of it than I do. I was still very moved by it and spent a lot of time discussing it afterwards (yes, I know it was supposed to be about more pairing, but today was a social day).</p>

<p>All in all, quality time dominated most of the day and I’m very happy - about new and old friends, discussions, bonding and Nutella. Yes, indulgences were on.</p>

  <li>had an awesome evening with RC women</li>
  <li>found out what my RC pseudonym is</li>
</ul>

<p>Loved ones took most of the day today, as I spent a lot of time on Skype. It has become sort of a routine to call them at least once a week and whenever I have Internet access, I can’t miss them too much.</p>

<p>I got bargain noise-cancelling over-ear headphones, which makes me very happy - bye, bye headphone headaches. I’m now completely surrounded by music and silence to work. I’ve also found a new place to stay after my current sublet. Both thanks to RC community.</p>

<p>In the evening, I’ve spent some time with other RC women from our and the upcoming batches. All women meetings should be more of a thing, especially in the tech community. I do miss all the women in my life a lot and it helps to have new friendships here.</p>

<p>When we apply to RC, we get automatically generated pseudonyms to reduce bias (more on this in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/43-building-a-better-and-more-diverse-community">this</a> post by Nick). Mine is totally awesome - Feature Fog. I can’t wait to use it in a programming context soon.</p>

          <p>Achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>got a lot of rest</li>
  <li>reflected on my first six weeks at RC</li>
  <li>discovered my patronus</li>
</ul>

<p>Six weeks ago I came to NYC with a very vague idea of what I wanted to do specifically. There seemed to be so many things I wanted and ‘had’ to learn - algorithms, networking, CS, ‘proper’ programming (whatever that means), machine learning, better visualisations, APIs, audio processing etc. The list could go on and on, as for the first few days I was utterly distracted and lost.</p>

<p>Over the course of the first half of my batch, I’ve tried and resigned from many things. I didn’t work enough on my ‘big’ project, I felt that some methods of learning or topics I wanted to learn do not resonate with me. I’ve been going to workshops, sometimes a few a day, trying to learn as much as possible. At the same time, I was constantly amazed by the degree of focus of some of my fellow batchers, especially those who came here for ‘only’ six weeks.</p>

<p>The health scare last week was a wake-up call - I’ve been overworking myself, overdosing on the wonderful experience that is RC. Yes, it was great to get up every morning full of plans and with my to-do list bursting. To rush for my morning meditation and check-in, feeling like I’m moving forward. But I need to shift my focus and adjust my goals, otherwise I might lose my motivation altogether. After all, it’s all about never graduating.</p>

<p>As such, I have a few areas and goals to focus on, distilled from the vast universe of possibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I still want to build my language-learning app, a project I’ve spread into tiny tasks that are now somewhere near the end of my to-do list under an avalanche of ideas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I love talking to people and I’ve been doing a lot of that, but I want to talk more about programming, which means more pairing - at least part of it should be focused on pursuing my projects</p>
  </li>
  <li>shortlist of bigger projects:
    <ul>
      <li>language-learning app (possible pairing on audio processing, APIs and web dev)</li>
      <li>learning React while building an app (I have some ideas I would like to work on, especially with Ivo)</li>
      <li>building my own Markdown editor, either web or for MacOS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>career goals:
    <ul>
      <li>writing 10 professional blog posts by the end of my stay in the US</li>
      <li>applying for the remote opportunity I’m excited about (but don’t want to write about it too much, as not to jinx it)</li>
      <li>having at least 2 interview prep sessions a week</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>productive procrastination:
    <ul>
      <li>an ongoing list of shorter projects to learn specific programming skills</li>
      <li>making small 3D printed prototypes for future DYIing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5 hours a week for a non-programming learning project</p>
  </li>
  <li>spending Sundays and most of Saturdays on sightseeing/socializing</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the first half of my batch was a perspective-changing experience. I’ll work on the next six weeks to be even better.</p>

<p>Other than reflections, plans and rest, I’ve had a fun few minutes with discovering <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/news/discover-your-patronus-on-pottermore">my patronus on Pottermore</a>. Apparently it’s a weasel, which doesn’t seem too far removed from a squirrel I’ve always imagined it to be.</p>

  <li>planned a mob coding session with James</li>
  <li>had a great algorithms prep with Taylor</li>
  <li>took part in Mike’s Internet protocols workshop</li>
  <li>tweaked my setup</li>
  <li>played board games</li>
</ul>

<p>Started the day perfectly with Sean’s scones, I’ve had a productive short session with James on the mob coding for the new batch on Monday. We’ll try to code a working Hangman implementation in Python in 45 minutes.</p>

<p>My first algorithms prep was great, I don’t think I could’ve had a better partner for that than Taylor. I worked on a fairly simple matrix problem first, with some helpful feedback from Taylor, and then he got to work on a simple-turned-complicated brain teaser. I will definitely try to have more prep over the next 6 weeks and with more challenging questions.</p>

<p>Mike’s Internet protocols workshop (alternatively known as sniffing the glue that holds the Internet together) was comprehensive and helpful. I look forward to the next 5 or so sessions ahead of us. Mike is a great teacher! He managed to make a not so interesting topic fascinating, with a lot of examples of real-world usage and further steps for learning.</p>

<p>Other than that I tweaked my setup a little bit, since some fellow Recursers had problems with reading my syntax highlighting during pairing. Too be fair, the tiny-tiny letters on my screen are not of much help either, but since there is a simple enough shortcut for that, I’m not going to change it just yet. My bash prompt welcomes me now with a little heart.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56085440/photos/other/bash_prompt.png" /></p>

<p>We stayed quite late at the RC, playing board games and solving problems in our apps (but mostly board games). I love the space so much, I sometimes wish I could just not sleep at all.</p>

  <li>worked with Jeni, Alicia and Satabdi on the sexism tracking app</li>
  <li>Abstract Salad Factory</li>
  <li>MCed presentations</li>
  <li>had fun at the farewell picnic</li>
  <li>walked through the Brooklyn Bridge</li>
</ul>

<p>The productive part of the day was really short, since today we had a farewell picnic for the Summer 2 batch (who overlapped with us) and some of our fellow batchers from Fall 1, who came here only for six weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve managed to get some coding started on our sexism tracking app, pairing with Jeni on views. The Abstract Salad Factory helped me then with not feeling guilty about indulging myself during the presentations and the picnic.</p>

<p>I volunteered to MC the presentations, i.e. being the master of ceremonies - introducing speakers and making sure everything works out. It was fun, albeit a bit stressful. I had to come up to every person that was presenting, interrupt their last touchups and make sure their laptops work with the projector, the loudspeakers won’t make everybody’s ears bleed and they have whatever they might need. Even though I’ve had a few missteps on the way, everything ran pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>Presentations themselves were hilarious, some of my favourites were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lareine’s implementation of ethical engineering algorithm, with some surprising turns on who “deserves” to live - <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8yd8d0ynkw25oxx/Ethical%20Engineering.pptx">here</a> are some of her thoughts from the previous presentation</li>
  <li>Jesse’s <a href="https://github.com/JesseRap/RoboDJ">DJ app</a>, on which he worked together with Taylor - it automatically mixes music, just as a DJ would</li>
  <li>Michelle’s <a href="http://i17on.com/">intranationalization engine for Markdown</a>, which she hilariously presented with examples of possible uses of filtering words in text (e.g. you might want your resume to be “tech” for some people, but “fun” for others)</li>
  <li>Juan’s <a href="https://github.com/jhbabon/johnny_eight">CHIP-8</a> emulator, which he got to play pong!</li>
</ul>

<p>We went to the Brooklyn Bridge park and had a few wonderful hours in the sun, eating snacks and playing some outdoor sports. I learned to throw the egghand (Americans would call it football), but I need to work on not getting hit in the face with it. Also, a squirrel was very into our cookies and she was very impatient.</p>

<p>I’ve also tried an American burger for the very first time and the experience was a bit disturbing - it tasted like something twice deep-fried. Striving to have more NYC experiences, I went on a walk through Brooklyn Bridge, or rather was dragged through it with the help of Cihan and Joe. It is ver high and the sidewalk is made of wood, my fear of heights won’t let me forget about it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>worked with Alicia, Jeni and Satabdi on the sexism-tracking app</li>
  <li>Brian’s workshop on RESTful API design</li>
  <li>Nick’s workshop on macOS development</li>
  <li>refactored my code with Cihan</li>
  <li>written niceties for fellow Recursers</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a pretty good feeling about our sexism-tracking app. It seems self-contained, pretty well planned and it will hopefully turn out to be useful - I’m especially up for doing a lot of data visualisation. The first session was mostly about setting up the environment and I went down the rabbit hole with the virtual environment, as it didn’t like to have a space in the path name for my app.</p>

<p>Brian’s workshop on RESTful API design was concise and well planned, I’ll be using his notes shortly. Nick has provided us with such a vast amount of knowledge on macOS development, I’ll need to pair with him soon to wrap my mind around it. I’ve always wanted to have my own Markdown writing app, so it fits perfectly with my programming bucket list.</p>

<p>As I didn’t feel productive enough, I’ve had an impromptu session of refactoring my JS calendar with Cihan. He’s a great pairing navigator - intimidating me into working on my code by sitting and waiting for me to answer my own questions (this was not sarcastic, he’s so much fun to work with!)</p>

<p>I’ve also spent an hour on writing niceties for our fellow Recursers, whose (half-)batch is ending soon. It was wonderful to be able to share all the feelings and gratitude, but also sad to think they’ll be gone soon. Alas, you can never be truly gone from the RC community.</p>

<p>Over all, the day went pretty great, even though I didn’t make it for today’s experimental check-in. I didn’t plan for it, it’s just that yesterday evening I met Luna - an RC alumni - with whom I’ve spend a better part of three hours completely lost in conversation and didn’t get back to the apartment soon enough to wake up on time. I think it falls into the category of “first world problems” - I have so many amazing people to meet and talk to that I can’t find time to sleep or be productive enough. I’ve done it yet again during the day - an innocent conversation with John turned into a 1.5h+ experience.</p>

          <p>Achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learned more about Django REST framework</li>
  <li>V’s workshop on Git Internals in Git</li>
  <li>read a hilarious article on Ruby vs Python</li>
  <li>planned a mob coding session for the new batch</li>
</ul>

<p>As the sexism-tracking app will be built in Django, I wanted to learn more about the REST framework. The RESTful API design workshop was moved till Wednesday, so I’ll probably work on it a little bit more during the weekend.</p>

<p>V had a cool workshop on Git internals done entirely in Git. I didn’t feel I knew enough to understand and appreciate it enough, but I’ll definitely go through it again as soon as I have some time to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUCwr1Y6bFI">Emily’s presentation on Git</a>, as I’ve heard it might be very helpful.</p>

<p>Other than that, I was mostly browsing and organising. This <a href="https://hackernoon.com/ruby-vs-python-the-definitive-faq-5cb0046292be#.adrdav245">hilarious article</a> on Ruby vs Python made my evening. Following into Alicia’s footsteps, I’ve decided to do a mob coding session for the new batch on Monday and I’m still looking for just the right challenge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>started the week right with experimental check-in group</li>
  <li>paired with Ivan on improving blog loading</li>
  <li>worked on an app concept with Alicia, Isla and Juan</li>
  <li>took part in Lyn’s OpenGL workshop</li>
  <li>discussed my next portfolio + blog steps with Jeni</li>
  <li>had some inspiration for growing as a programmer</li>
</ul>

<p>The experimental check-in group is about accountability, so we’ve started the week with assigning each other a person to help us and someone we could help with their work. I got a lot of support from Jeni on my writing and discussed Aissam’s app with him (though I don’t feel I’ve helped him much).</p>

<p>We’ve also done the initial planning for our problem-tracking app - we’re going to set it up in Django and do the initial functionality in plain HTML + CSS, to be further improved with proper JS (we might even try a JS framework, though it seems like a lot of work for a tiny app).</p>

<p>Other than that, the OpenGL workshop brought some inspiration, but I’m afraid I don’t have enough time for it now, with all the career- and CS-focused tasks ahead. I have some ideas on my next career steps, but I need to clarify and commit to them.</p>

  <li>awesome women’s night at RC</li>
</ul>

<p>Cats, books and <em>Stranger Things</em> kept me entertained most of the day. The kitties are playful and curious, constantly nagging me for attention. Focusing was not an easy task.</p>

<p>We’ve also had a great women’s night at RC, thanks to Isla &amp; Kaylyn (and RC staff, of course), discussing some of our experiences and developing strategies and actionable solutions to common problems.</p>

<p>I especially loved two simple strategies presented by Alicia:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>inappropriate comment</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ask the person to repeat their comment, to avoid ambiguity (e.g. what did you say? what do you mean by that? excuse me?)</li>
      <li>label the comment/language (e.g. that’s ignorant/sexist/dismissive), not the person</li>
      <li>get back to work (after all, you are paid to work and hopefully so is the other person)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unwelcome behaviour</p>

    <p>Instead of reacting on the spot, it’s best to talk in person, e.g. “I feel like you interrupt me, have you noticed?” - that’s a simple yes or no question and both answers are great!</p>

    <ol>
      <li>yes - “good! please don’t do that again”</li>
      <li>no - “no problem, how about I just let you know if I notice it again?” (opening for further improvement)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is much easier to react and solve problems when we can name them. And we don’t feel crazy, because it’s not “just you” or “an incident” - it’s something many women experience daily.</p>

<p>We also came up with an idea for an app to register unwanted behaviours and easily visualise them, which I hope to mob code with my awesome RC friends over the next week.</p>

<p>I’m rarely in all women environments and it was freeing to experience that. Without men around we behave differently, focusing on communication rather than perceptions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>architectural whiteboarding</li>
  <li>mob coding with brownie shots</li>
  <li>committing the weekend to focus</li>
</ul>

<p>I was worried the whiteboarding will not go well, as I’ve never done it before and didn’t feel I know enough to answer any questions. I’ve read up on anything I could find on the topic and headed to Turing a bit lightheaded.</p>

<p>The flaw in my reasoning was forgetting that this was RC and the purpose is to learn, not stress. I’ve spent 3 wonderful hours with Bert, Alicia, Ivan and James, going through 5 questions altogether. When we finished I felt a bit dizzy from all the problem solving.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Joe, Cihan and me followed through with the idea of mob coding with enhanced brownies. A few rounds of Malibu with milk later and full of chocolate, we’ve managed to solve a fairly simple graph problem.</p>

<p>I couldn’t stay for the debugging, as today my cat sitting responsibilities started. Both fluffs are keen to play and curious, chasing after anything that moves (even if it doesn’t). Danielle and David’s apartment is full of books on programming and art, with even more fiction, especially of the sf nature. With cats, books and loads of space, it feels like a perfect focused getaway.</p>

  <li>had a presentation on learning new skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Thursday was a presentation day. We’ve had 8 usual evening presentations and 12 non-technical talks, amounting to three hours of learning something new every 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Three technical talks I enjoyed most were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Satabdi’s <a href="https://satabdidas.github.io/NoteRanger/">Noteranger</a> app for searching her notes</li>
  <li>Andrea’s great idea for <a href="https://github.com/aheyman11/art-visualization-by-style">visualising art</a> by style (I’d love to learn more about convolutional neural networks)</li>
  <li>Marf’s coverage of her two-week spree of exclusively pairing made me want to pair more</li>
</ul>

<p>The non-technical talks were so diverse it’s really hard to pick favourites, but some of them resonated with me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alicia’s talk on media literacy and porn consumption was marvelous, I hope she shares her thesis with us (I’ve only managed to find the title <em>Media Literacy for Pornography: Assessing the Impact of an Experimental Curriculum</em>)</li>
  <li>Sarah’s thoughts on improv inspired me to try it - hope to do it at RC soon</li>
  <li>Juliano’s description on physiology of singing was cut short, would love to hear more about it (workshop anyone?)</li>
  <li>Isabel’s presentation on genome editing with CRISPR brought some hopes for the H+ enthusiast in me</li>
  <li>Taylor guided us rapidly through literary theory</li>
  <li>James shared some insights on jazz reharmonisation, which makes me want to learn to play guitar properly even more</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve had my own non-techical moment on <em>The First 20 Hours</em> book and I’m hoping on writing a proper blog post on it soon and start my first learning experiment next week.</p>

<p>Everything is great now.</p>

<p>Wednesday I had a health scare - I fainted on the subway and ended up in a hospital. Nothing much happened, apart from lightly hitting my head on the subway car.</p>

<p>The experience was really stressful because of the insurance. Instead of keeping my cool and being happy someone takes care of me, I was constantly trying to calculate if my travel insurance is going to cover it. That’s a very US experience.</p>

<p>What surprised me is that you get the bill for emergency care about 4-6 weeks after the incident and you actually get three bills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one from the ambulance company, because the ambulances are privately owned</li>
  <li>one from the hospital</li>
  <li>one from the doctor that checks you up at the hospital</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether an ambulance ride, an ECG &amp; a blood pressure check at the hospital and a two minute chat with the doctor can cost anything between $2.000 and $8.000. Good my insurance is for more than $30.000.</p>

<p>With the Airbnb problems and lack of productivity over the weekend, I felt lost and extremely stressed. Luckily, my loved ones and the RC community were there for me. I decided to take it slow.</p>

  <li>refactoring some of my older projects that I can quickly improve and use in my portfolio</li>
  <li>writing long overdue blog posts for my official blog</li>
  <li>working more on the GitBook, as it is a project with community values in mind</li>
  <li>looking into remote work opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also reread a book on acquiring new skills - <a href="https://first20hours.com/">First 20 Hours</a> by Josh Kaufman - and I’m going to use the concepts to improve my learning over the next few weeks. I also want to have a short presentation on the topic, since it is a system of simple concepts that can be useful to others.</p>

<p>In terms of long-term goals, I’ve revised my bucket, project, learning and productive procrastination lists (I seem to love lists for some reason). I’ve changed some priorities and aligned them more with my programming skills.</p>

<p>The Internet came back today in the afternoon. Oh, the joy!</p>

<p>I’ve finally got some peace of mind with the apartment situation. Got in touch with Tom and will be staying at his apartment till Oct 3rd. Got in touch with Airbnb and will get a full refund for the remainder of my stay. Got my suitcase to RC from Uptown.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was mostly about reading and chilling, since I didn’t even realise all the Airbnb stuff was so stressful.</p>

<p>The new chill room (Babbage) is perfect for reading and napping and reading some more.</p>

<p>Yes, there was still no Internet. I’ve had a plan for that - going for a banana coffee in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>First I had a total derp moment with swiping my Metrocard and not passing fast enough. So I decided to walk to the nearest bookstore, but it was closed. Apparently, the city never sleeps, but the books need some rest.</p>

<p>The Internet was down also in the bank, so I walked and got lost a few times to withdraw some cash. Then I took the subway to Brooklyn, where the J+B cafe I wanted to get my banana coffee at was closed.</p>

<p>I took it surprisingly well and just went for a walk through Brooklyn, took the wrong subway, walked some more in Lower Manhattan and ended up at a Korean cafe for misugaru latte.</p>

<p>Got back to the RC. Had fun with Lisa, John and Cihran rearranging the space a little bit. Ended the day with blissful hours of reading and cuddling with Ginger.</p>

<p>Plague prevailed and spread - there was no Internet today neither at RC, nor at the Airbnb. Funny how easy it is to forget how often I use it. And how safe it makes me feel. With the ability to contact my loved ones any time I want, I haven’t really felt far from home up till now.</p>

<p>I decided to make an exercise on patience out of it. I’ve been doing everything I could without Internet, untilI really needed it - mostly to check my email and organise a new apartment.</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share your grapes (literal grapes, when you buy 2+ lbs)</li>
  <li>pick up random books that look fun</li>
  <li>add pumpkin spice to your morning coffee before you pour hot water in</li>
  <li>breathe</li>
  <li>if someone offers to share their data plan - use it for the sake of your sanity (thank you V!)</li>
  <li>chocolate soothes all stress</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve created a simple <a href="https://trueskawka.github.io/timer">52/17 timer</a> (52 minutes for work, 17 minutes playtime), since <a href="http://www.pcgeek.info/fokasu/">Fokasu</a> has irritating advertisements and it was a good exercise on programming without Internet. Never thought simple JavaScript can take so much time.</p>

<p>I also read two books I randomly picked in the library, based entirely on their covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302971.Happier">Happier</a> by Tal Ben-Shahar, with a lot of ideas on how to improve your happiness and a few exercises I’ve added to my productive procrastination list</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21487480-if-hemingway-wrote-javascript">If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript</a> by Angus Croll, a hilarious little book on how different writers would write JavaScript programs - my favourites were:</p>

<p>I wanted to end the day on a positive note, so I got creative on the whiteboard.</p>

<p>It’s very hard to find an affordable room in NYC, especially with the stress of running from cockroaches ASAP.</p>

<p>It’s much easier when you have Eva &amp; Shawn as a part of your family and a community of Recursers.</p>

<p>Airbnb agreed to a full refund on my remaining stay at the apartment, so I’ve spent most of the day looking for an affordable and clean room. As it turns out, it’s not easy (unless your definition of affordable and/or clean is more flexible). I turned to my community and got offered so much help the stress magically disappeared.</p>

<p>As the day was mostly focused on the mundane, I took two small steps to be a better programmer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read a great article on <a href="https://iluxonchik.github.io/regular-expression-check-if-number-is-prime/">prime number checking regex</a> shared by Juan (and went into a wild regex learning spiral)</li>
  <li>did <a href="https://trueskawka.github.io/flowing">my first project in p5.js</a> thanks to Emily’s instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully by the end of the weekend I’ll have a new place to sleep and thus be able to create even more.</p>

<p>In the evening a tragic thing happened to all of us - Internet connection stopped working at the RC and we all had to go home before midnight. Let’s hope this disaster passes with the new day rising.</p>

  <li>wrote Airbnb about switching apartments</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess there comes a point when enough is enough. Tonight the subway took record time to get from Brooklyn to Uptown - more than 2 hours. For about an hour the train was just standing in the tunnel and waiting, without much information why and when will we start moving again. Dead tired and disappointed, I got to the apartment and decided to switch as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Apart from the local transport incidents, the day was great. I attended a workshop on how to read code first thing in the morning, had a check-in, then a long nap (it’s sometimes much better to simply let it go for a moment). I then contacted Airbnb and mostly worked on my presentation, learning more about Jekyll plugins in the meantime.</p>

<p>The presentations were wonderful, I couldn’t decide on just three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Andrey’s <a href="https://boip.me/">birthday over IP app</a> was wonderful, I will be sure to use it while in the US</li>
  <li>Ivan’s live coded implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/gudnm/brainf_ck-interpreter">Brainfuck REPL</a> in five minutes was jaw-dropping</li>
  <li>Andy’s talk on his chess playing app was hilarious, my quote of the day is <em>programmers use code to conquer personal shortcomings</em> - he is yet another person who should do developer stand-up</li>
  <li>Harold had a great presentation on <a href="https://github.com/hrldcpr/word-embeddings">word embedding</a>, I will always remember that
<code>most_similar(vectors['paris'] - vectors['france'] + vectors['poland'])</code>
equals Warsaw</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, Emily introduced us to <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and my first app will hopefully be finished by the end of the day tomorrow. I loved <a href="http://xie-emily.com/projects.html">her work</a> and the way she conducted the workshop.</p>

  <li>went to Drunk TED Talks</li>
</ul>

<p>Living in the Uptown New York has some ups and downs, sadly mostly downs - I was late for my check-in, as going back to the apartment yesterday took me twice as long as usual. I should probably not use the subway after 11pm and lower my expectations. I’ll just think about it as a suburban train rather than what we consider a subway in Europe.</p>

<p>Jesse was kind enough to do another round of his Swift workshop and I’ve built my first iOS app - a simple implementation of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lights_Out_(game)">Lights Out</a>. It was a fun afternoon activity.</p>

<p>I’ve randomly started talking to Aissam about his current work on <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> - a technology that allows streaming video and audio through a simple implementation in the browser. We paired on a Snapchat-like feature I hope he’ll present some time soon.</p>

<p>In the evening we went for Drunk TED Talks on conspiracies. With something advertised as “TED talks” I expected it to be a bit different - the presentations weren’t TED-like, but some presenters did look drunk. There were four conspiracy areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nicolas Cage</li>
  <li>One Direction</li>
  <li>Blood Cults</li>
  <li>Jill Stein (Green Party candidate for the US president)</li>
</ul>

<p>I never thought I’d say that, but the most interesting presentation was on One Direction. There was also a Polish accent I didn’t expect - apparently there is an XVIII-century painting by Karol de Prevot in Sandomierz’s cathedral, allegedly depicting <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Sandomierz_katedra_-_mord_rytualny.jpg?1473366039540">ritual murder of Christians by Jews</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went for drinks to a very nice pub. I’ve tried some seaweed cider, but opted for a regular apple one - the salty taste and seaweed smell weren’t really appealing.</p>

</ul>

<p>This week I’ve switched to working mostly with Jekyll, as the blog and website turned out to be a pretty interesting side project. I’ve started writing a <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/trueskawka/so-you-want-a-jekyll-blog/">GitBook</a> on Jekyll (or more accurately - I wrote a <em>Readme</em> draft), as a byproduct of my learning efforts, as it may be useful to others.</p>

<p>I’ve had a chance to pair with Juan and understand better how Jekyll plugins work. Together we’ve created a plugin for generating a subpage for every category and date. I then implemented them in my calendar - now you can click on any date that has posts and be redirected to an appropriate subpage.</p>

<p>I also worked on my presentation, as 5 minutes needs far more work than a half-hour format, which I’m generally used to. I’m keeping it fun and simple, hopefully it will be interesting enough.</p>

<p>Podcasts are great, I’m listening to them whenever I’m not working. The thread on Zulip grew pretty fast and now I have far more recommendations than I could hope to check in the next month, but that just makes it a challenge, doesn’t it? So far I’ve only listened to all <a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes521594713/you-are-not-so-smart">You are not so smart</a> episodes on logical fallacies and some <a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes318345767/the-partially-examined-life-philosophy-podcast">Partially Examined Life</a>, but the list is slowly growing.</p>

  <li>warm-up in Ruby</li>
  <li>chat with Adam on frontend design and workflow</li>
  <li>redesigned my main website</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the day I’ve been redesigning my <a href="https://trueskawka.github.io/">main website</a> to match the blog. I’ve rewritten and simplified the CSS, done some heavy-lifting with reorganising language versions and created a simple logo out of my initials.</p>

<p>I had a nice chat with Adam, who pointed out some things I should work on and the general flow of frontend design. It was pretty helpful, as I disregarded the problems that can arise with a “simple” blog design and maintenance (especially the maintenance). My presentation is growing and mutating, I’m not sure how will it look on Thursday.</p>

<p>As I was feeling unproductive, we went for a short walk with Juliano to get a coffee. Starbucks in Poland may be very different or “Chile Mocha” is something that just doesn’t taste right, either way - don’t drink it. We’ve had a chance to observe some cute and enormous squirrels. Yes, I am going to use squirrel photos to obscure my lower than desired productivity.</p>

<p>After a long night comes a short day.</p>

<p>I didn’t do much today in terms of working towards my goals, as I was too unfocused to be productive. After walking through Central Park, I mostly worked on getting better organized and reflecting on the first quarter of my batch. All in all it went pretty well, but I want to be more focused and have more tangible products while working towards my goals.</p>

<p>I programmed a bit in Ruby today and learned a lot about exception handling, though I’m not entirely sure I know enough to feel confident using it. I also set-up a long-awaited podcast habit and hope to strengthen it over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>It was a long night. We went for Korean BBQ, planning to come back and do some more programming, but from BBQ we went for some more soju (Korean alcohol) and ended up at a Korean karaoke. It was loads of fun and next week we’ll probably try some Polish cuisine, as Joe was pretty tired of being the guide.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to give a presentation on Thursday on a completely different topic than I initially planned. Instead of pushing my audio analyses and possibly failing to meet the deadline, I want to talk about the blog. From a side, lightweight project it turned into a learning opportunity I didn’t expect.</p>

<p>Juliano was a pretty good rubber duck for Jekyll.</p>

  <li>keeping the meditation habit streak</li>
  <li>warm-up in Ruby</li>
  <li>algorithms (Stanford course) check-in</li>
  <li>adding a MVP of a calendar to the blog</li>
  <li>starting a course on CS in Python</li>
  <li>trying Halo Top ice cream (and eating only half of them)</li>
  <li>getting a gig as a cat sitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Fri-yay has come. The day when sleeping in after a busy week is acceptable. The day when going on a long walk just to get protein ice cream is reasonable.</p>

<p>I’ve managed to barely keep my streaks in order today, meditating on the subway while being very late and doing a warm-up right before the algorithms group meeting.</p>

<p>On top of my algorithms course I still have to catch up with the rest of the group, I’ve started a new CS course in Python (because I want to learn the language and ‘proper’ programming better) and I’m getting ready for the course on audio analysis (because I want to implement some of it in my language-learning app). It does seem like much, but structured courses and peer pressure help with motivation, so I’m going to try managing all three of them over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I wanted to create a simple and fast github-like calendar for my blog, which turned out to be surprisingly difficult, as I’ve managed to forget all of my JS over the past few months. I got to a <a href="https://github.com/trueskawka/simple_js_calendar">Minimum Viable Product</a> after a few hours of relearning the language. I’m planning to introduce more web development back into my routine, I don’t want it to get rusty.</p>

<p>As for the cat sitter gig, I got the dibs on spending a weekend with these <a href="http://twitter.com/bigfloofs">two sweet fluffs</a> in two weeks, which will be a great opportunity to have a completely distraction free few days (minus the belly rubs), focusing on my learning.</p>

</ul>

<p>Thursday is a bonding day, with the alumni in the space, presentations and events in the evening.</p>

<p>Abstract Salad Factory was just the beginning of it - a group of people brought various ingredients for salads and then we mixed, matched and stuffed ourselves.</p>

<p>My top three community presentations were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/JKiely/Totes-Random">Totes Random</a> - an app generating random numbers from tweets by John, Sean and Taylor</li>
  <li>an <a href="https://github.com/leeorb321/expenses">expense tracker</a> with some nifty visuals by Leeor and Taylor</li>
  <li>a presentation on analogies by Naomi</li>
</ul>

<p>I also took part in Jade’s intro to 3D printing, by doing my first live coding ever. It was stressful, but great, which means I should do it again.</p>

<p>The Arts and Crafts night was full of fun. There was knitting, drawing, sewing, origami, face painting, hairpin glueing, magnet making, eating and laughing. Some Recurses worked in the midst of it all - I admire their ability to focus, wish mine was that good.</p>

<p>Most of today went as planned. I got in early, done my daily morning habits of coffee with oatmeal, housekeeping and meditation.</p>

<p>I’ve had a wonderful session of creating a 3D printed paper boat with Jade, writing a wiki entry about it for tomorrow’s Arts &amp; Crafts night.</p>

<p>Pairing with Rose didn’t go as planned, as I don’t know enough about audio analysis and jumped into it too quickly. I’ve learned a lot in terms of next steps and I’m not up for using someone else’s time until I’m ready.</p>

<p>Circle code dojo was fun - we were pair programming in cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first person was driving, navigated by the person to their left</li>
  <li>after 5 minutes we all moved one chair left</li>
  <li>the first person was then navigating the person to their right</li>
</ul>

<p>And then everyone would be a driver and a navigator at least once in the cycle. We were working on the good old Mastermind and at some point we’ve managed to win our own game.</p>

<p>Other than that, I was pretty productive with my algorithms and reading. I also bought a backpack, since I have to carry a lot every day and my bag didn’t help with back pains.</p>

<p>
I couldn't sleep today so I got to the RC as soon as possible, since there is nothing much I could do at the apartment. In the morning the trains don't have so many delays and it's also not as hot, so it might be a good longterm strategy.
</p>
<p>
I finally evaluated how much uninterrupted time it takes before I am productive - breakfast, coffee, reading emails, checking social media and various news channels. I never thought it takes about 1.5 hours, which may explain why I always underestimate my workload. It's not that I need to be more efficient with it, just never thought about it much - after all, it's "just" a few things.
</p>
<p>
I'm pleased with my level of focus and productivity today. I've read a lot of algorithms books, done some coding, felt like I was going in the right direction to be a better programmer. The only downside was I needed a nap halfway through, as I'm not used to getting up so early. Maybe it's just how I'm supposed to work and I should take it into account over the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I went to the used books store and managed not to buy another book, which is something, seeing as it seems to be an addiction that runs in the family.
</p>
<p>
The evening was fun and inspiring, as I went to the Hack&amp;&amp;Tell meetup - a series of 5-minute presentations followed by 5-minute Q&amp;A sessions about projects people do in their free time for the pure fun of it. I came up with at least a dozen ideas on what I could do and I'll have to keep myself focused, but it was worth it. The presentations were:
<ul>
<li>virtual reality in JavaScript - <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/turing-incomplete/turing-incomtweet">automatisation of Twitter posts</a> for the <a href="http://turing.cool/">Turing incomplete</a> podcast</li>
<li>a new programming language called <a href="http://www.ziglang.org">Zig</a></li>
<li>useful and tiny website <a href="http://www.ismytrainfucked.com">ismytrainfucked.com</a></li>
<li>a game with Google ngrams dataset "Word Freq"</li>
<li><a href="http://boustro.com/app">an app</a> for <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Boustrophedon">buostrofying</a> text</li>
<li>a JavaScript application of spreadsheets called <a href="https://github.com/gmarceau/spread.js">spread.js</a></li>
<li>visualisation of NYC violations by precinct</li>
<li>simulation of the way colourblind see the world, to help designers create better products</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JonHMChan/descartes">Descartes</a> - CSS written in JS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I don't think I'll be able to not do any side projects, as I won a book - <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022657.do"><i>Kinect Hacks - Tips &amp; Tools for Motion and Pattern Detection</i></a>. I'm having some wild ideas about working with videos of Ginger.

<p>
After a quiet weekend at the RC, focusing today was much harder than expected. Thankfully, I already have some daily habits and starting the day with them helps me with unproductiveness and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
In terms of my main project, I haven't done much, but I'm planning to have a pairing session with Rose on Wednesday and do some research and work before that.
</p>
<p>
Gerald Sussman (the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT and Board Member of the Free Software Foundation) visited RC today and had a guest lecture on flexible systems in the evening. I must admit I haven't heard about him before RC. I admire his passion and skills, I think some people my age lack this kind of direction and focus.
</p>
<p>
As I didn't feel secure enough to say anything remotely interesting for him, I asked about his views on online education and some book recommendations for learning more about AI. I've also managed to ask a question after the lecture and got a pretty inspiring answer:
<blockquote>I want to enhance the lives of people who are having fun programming, not because it's a job they do, but because they want to think, and they want to learn by writing programs that help them think</blockquote>
<br />
I'm going to write more about the lecture itself later on, but I first need to wrap my mind around it.

Most of today was about having some leisure time, but I've managed to do the daily habits I've developed at the RC so far. I needed to work on the algorithms course, as I was far behind other group members. In between I also found the time to read some "Gödel, Escher, Bach" - a book I've wanted to read for a few years now and never got to it. I also bought "The Elements of Style", as I've heard is quite popular in the US to read it in college - I want to work on my writing.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow's going to be productive.

<p>
Today I've learned how post-it notes and a few hours can be used for an awesome afternoon. I've finally had my first board-game design session with Tanoy.
</p>
<p>
The game theme is sailing in a small boat through open and dangerous seas. First we did some brainstorming, while munching cookies, and after we've been happy with the initial ideas we got down to prototyping. Making the tiny boats, board and all kinds of tokens made it suddenly very real.
</p>
<p>
The main takeout from today is that we need to play the game and adjust, rather than just talk about concepts and get more and more excited. Next session will probably happen next week and, if everything goes well, we'll soon create prototypes to play them with other RCers.
</p>
<p>
This game is supposed to be mainly a case study for game design, so I can learn to do it better. But if something cute and fun happens on the way, then it's even more worth it.
</p>
<p>
As for the failed shopping - I wanted to buy shoes, as I've managed to break a pair during yesterday's karaoke. I ended up getting a big mug and two books.

<p>
Today was mostly about bonding.
</p>
<p>
After starting the day right with meditation, pairing with <b>Vaibhav</b> and <b>Isla</b> during the refactoring dojo was a wonderful experience. We did the <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata">Tennis Refactoring Kata</a> in Python - worked together on purposely bad code in a way that didn't break the tests, but helped with understanding the underlying logic of the program.
</p>
<p>
Later we planned for a short meeting of the algorithms course group and ended up spending more than an hour together, crunching problem sets.
</p>
<p>
After a quick mini-session on Google Analytics with Jade, I went out for late lunch with a bunch of people, to also spend some time with Emil on his last day of residency at RC. After we got back, we've had an exciting code jeopardy (which <b>Vaibhav</b> ruled, I think he must've devoured Wikipedia). Short chat about karaoke revealed an existing RC karaoke app and that's when we found the box labeled "karaoke". A few hours later, extremely tired and very happy we went our separate ways, to get some sleep after an awesome night.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, the setup was professional - we were using a projector, two mics, a disco-ball and a big chunk of the floor to dance while singing.

This was the most intense day at RC so far. From the check-in at 10:30am until the end of presentations at 6:30pm I've had only two short breaks.
</p>
<h4>NLP workshop</h4>
<p>
The NLP workshop was more theoretical than I expected, focusing on efficient way to represent probabilities. I'd love to get to the nitty-gritty of the implementation for parts of speech tagging, but it was still quite a useful setup for thinking about language processing.
</p>
<h4>Code retreat</h4>
<p>
For the code retreat we did pair-programmed, test-driven Game of Life in four runs. My coding partners were (I guess "J" was the letter of the day):
<ul>
<li><b>Jade</b> for the initial Python look at the problem, with extremely detailed unit tests, which was a great starting point,</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> for a little bit more broad approach to it in Ruby, which taught me a lot about best practices in a very short time,</li>
<li><b>James</b> for the second try in Python, this time trying it with sub-matrices and using the "neighbourhood" of a cell as a starting point,</li>
<li><b>Juliano</b> for some playtime with Elixir - we've had a great time pairing earlier this week, but today we were both way too tired to implement the problem or even recognise syntax problems.</li>
</ul>
The approach for the exercise was doing it test-first and throwing away the code after a pairing session. The rules for each one were:
<ul>
<li>ping-pong TDD - one person writes the test, the other one implementation and the next test, then the first one has to implement etc.,</li>
<li>3 line limit on methods,</li>
<li>no primitive data types (focusing on expressing in problem domain terms),</li>
<li>no conditional statements/no speaking (the second one could've been used as an additional constraint for some languages, as it's sometimes natural to not use conditional statements).</li>
</ul>
I would love to write more about the code retreat, but I feel I need a few days to think about all the benefits of it and reevaluate my strategy before the next one (because, obviously, there has to be a next one).
</p>
<h4>Goal-setting workshop</h4>
<p>
The goal-setting workshop was a surprisingly successful short exercise. We worked in groups of three, working on one person's goals at a time. First they would present their focus for the RC, achievements to date and possible problems that are holding them back. Then the other members of the group would discuss it briefly without the involvement of the presenter and at the end of focus mini-session they'd have some time to reflect on the insights.
</p>
<p>
I was pleasantly surprised how optimistic <b>David</b> and <b>Sofia-Jeanne</b> were about my goals and focus. The cute thing we did at the end of the workshop were paper cranes with our goals hidden inside, so we can unfold them at the end of our batch.
</p>
<p>
During the workshop we were also introduced to the concept of Test Driven Learning, which I think deserves a separate blog post as soon as I find some time.
</p>
<h4>Presentations</h4>
<p>
Presentations today were awesome (as usual), the ones I especially liked were:
<ul>
<li><b>Lareine's</b> approach to ethical engineering of self-driving cars (hilarious in a bit disturbing way)</li>
<li><b>James's</b> summary of the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fast_inverse_square_root">fast inverse square root</a> problem</li>
<li><b>Michelle's</b> cute little JS app I don't think she gave herself enough credit for</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
After so many adventures I went for a huge poke bowl with <b>Juliano</b> to a very nice place called Simple (some photos below).

<p>
Thinking about and reviewing my workflow with Emil today helped me reframe it from "this thing I should do perfectly to be a better programmer" to "a habit that helps me with my work". Sometimes the simplest things can help a lot.
</p>
<p>
Pairing with Spencer on audio was challenging, as I have only vague knowledge of audio processing and analysis, which my basic understanding of Python didn't help with. I got the sense of direction and next steps I want to do Saturday-ish, as Spencer agreed to do some work on it remotely.
</p>
<p>
Using a new tool can be confusing, so I got loads of help from Joe on how to use Jupyter notebooks. I find them very cool and useful for my Python &amp; CS learning.
</p>
<p>
Being at RC allows you to make mistakes openly and simply ask for help, even if you feel your problems are dumb or basic.
</p>
<p>
Also, turns out some people unexpectedly speak Polish - Emil surprised me with his skills during lunch. Kudos, I can't imagine learning a language that hard just because my spouse speaks it.
</p>
<p>
I'm still on my way to peak learning and productivity, so things are going to get more interesting.

<p>
Learning a new programming language can be challenging and the best way to do it is just jumping right into it. That's why I've spent 3+ hours pair programming with Juliano in Elixir, to implement <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> Turing machine.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, we've had a meeting to watch some Destroy All Software videos and I've managed to learn some algorithms.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is going to be better still, as I'm planning to get home before 10pm and get some much needed rest.

<p>
Pair programming is one of the best parts of the RC experience. Today I jumped into Python, although I never really enjoyed it. Also managed to schedule two new pair programming sessions this week - one in Python on audio and language recognition, one on the Turing machine with Elixir and Brainfuck.
</p>
<p>
One of the Recursers is planning on doing a 3D printing workshop and we came up with a few ideas for the arts and crafts night with his printer.
</p>
<p>
All in all, it just keeps getting better.

<p>
Setting up a meditation habit at 9:30 and doing it in a group makes it much easier to be at the RC on time. After a short session and breakfast, the trip was a great next step.
</p>
<p>
Sunday was a surprisingly packed day at the RC, with most Recursers trying some form pair programming. I wouldn't know much about it, since a bean bag in the quiet room turned out to have some sort of a spell on it and I slept most of the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Jin (Joe) from RC was kind enough to set up a meeting with his friend Jae, who works at Accenture. I'm still not sure about my next career step, so getting an honest opinion about it was pretty useful.
</p>
<p>
Turned out I was drinking an old-lady's drink - misugaru latte, a bean-based sweet treat with ice.
</p>
<p>
On my way back I did a very tourist thing - took a photo of the Empire State Building.</p>

I was the first to come and the last to go today. Saturday is the "real" weekend at RC, there was nearly nobody here. Apart from the very few people who don't have AC or have cockroaches at their Airbnbs.
</p>
<p>
Peaceful and productive.

Weekends at the RC start on Fridays. It's a time for some alone work and focus, or just walking around NYC and doing all the tourist stuff.

Even so, there were so many people here during the day, there was hardly any space left.

RC is a great place for random encounters. One person turns out to be selling cool Pythagorean Theorem earrings (as soon as I get mine will share pics), another designs board games and agrees to a random workshop on the topic. Philosophical discussions, business ideas, board games and pizza - perfect night in a perfect place.

I've spent most of the day on errands, as apparently the US banking system is very different. Should you ever wish to use an European debit card, be amused, as some ATMs and shops will accept it, and some others will treat is as a credit card. Which means you need to provide an American ZIP-code you don't have.
</p>
<p>
With my flow broken I've spend most of the evening acquiring data for my app, as it was a tedious but simple thing. Tomorrow I can start with first UI drafts and API integration.

It is very easy to get distracted at the RC. Everybody is doing something new and exciting, many people are feeling overwhelmed.
The first day was mostly about getting around the space, whilst the second is about settling and being more comfortable. Knowing where you're going for lunch or how to use the coffee grinder. Getting into the rhythm of morning check-ins, warmups and daily pair programming.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow I'm planning for more alone time, as I'm finally out of the rut and have some ideas on the first steps for my big project.

          <p>The Recurse Center is a very welcoming and open place I'm going to spend 90% of my time at. Not just because it's what I came here to do, but also because I love it.</p>
<p>I've met a ton of people:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Joseph</b> from LA, who's into data science and bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Isla</b>, a mathematician from Scotland who's also into bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Paul</b> from Ireland, who has a PhD in compilers and runs his own business</li>
<li><b>Satabdi</b>, a Bengali girl who wants to work on her functional programming</li>
<li><b>Zach</b>, a programmer for RC who advised me on how to deal with cockroaches and actually considers them a NYC thing</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, an Australian who loves her JavaScript</li>
<li><b>Leah</b> of Bellevue, who wants to go through a statistics textbook</li>
<li><b>Trey</b> from California, who is in his second batch to have some time for himself between jobs</li>
<li><b>David</b>, who doesn't use his Korean name and wants to build an SMT-solver</li>
<li><b>Lisa</b>, a facilitator from Texas who loves her Android</li>
<li><b>Amy</b> Pickup, whose surname I love, wants to build web apps</li>
<li><b>Vaibhav</b>, an Indonesian guy who's into Haskell</li>
<li><b>Alicia</b>, in love with healthcare and Python</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> of Peru, who wants to play with Erlang and Elixir</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, who's done so many things I can't even imagine pair programming with her</li>
<li><b>Ivan</b>, a Russian who wants to experiment with data science, among a ton of other things</li>
<li><b>Miguel</b>, another Haskell enthusiast from Colombia</li>
<li><b>Katherine</b>, a biologist who loves her Python and Vim</li>
<li><b>Lareine</b> from New Jersey, a very shy girl who has a lot to offer, especially with Arduino</li>
<li><b>Leeor</b> from Israel, a lawyer who turned to coding</li>
<li><b>Ivo</b>, a quiet web-dev from Lima</li>
<li><b>James</b>, a backend programmer turned RC facilitator from NY</li>
<li><b>?</b> from Mid-West, an geologist who does web dev and digs data science</li>
<li><b>Sean</b>, a graduate student in linguistics and language perception</li>
<li><b>Ginger</b>, a mix of a maltese and a poodle (maltipoo), who's just the cutest dog ever</li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the people I've talked (or played with in case of Ginger) at least for a few minutes. Altogether I've met about thrice as much.</p>
<p>On one hand, the first day was relaxing. We did introductions, first check-ins, lunch, developer speed-dating, some quiet time and a meetup.</p>
<p>On the other, reiterating my story with new people every few minutes was exhausting. I'm not sure I even know what I've said to most of them. Loads of new ideas, but also insecurity, as I don't know where to start.</p>
