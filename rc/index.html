          <h3>Paper boat earrings</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
Together with Jade we created 3D printed paper boat earrings. The first prototype was a bit too narrow and the walls were very thick, so the second one turned out just perfect with a broader base and slimmer build.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
I couldn't sleep today so I got to the RC as soon as possible, since there is nothing much I could do at the apartment. In the morning the trains don't have so many delays and it's also not as hot, so it might be a good longterm strategy.
</p>
<p>
I finally evaluated how much uninterrupted time it takes before I am productive - breakfast, coffee, reading emails, checking social media and various news channels. I never thought it takes about 1.5 hours, which may explain why I always underestimate my workload. It's not that I need to be more efficient with it, just never thought about it much - after all, it's "just" a few things.
</p>
<p>
I'm pleased with my level of focus and productivity today. I've read a lot of algorithms books, done some coding, felt like I was going in the right direction to be a better programmer. The only downside was I needed a nap halfway through, as I'm not used to getting up so early. Maybe it's just how I'm supposed to work and I should take it into account over the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I went to the used books store and managed not to buy another book, which is something, seeing as it seems to be an addiction that runs in the family.
</p>
<p>
The evening was fun and inspiring, as I went to the Hack&amp;&amp;Tell meetup - a series of 5-minute presentations followed by 5-minute Q&amp;A sessions about projects people do in their free time for the pure fun of it. I came up with at least a dozen ideas on what I could do and I'll have to keep myself focused, but it was worth it. The presentations were:
<ul>
<li>virtual reality in JavaScript - <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/turing-incomplete/turing-incomtweet">automatisation of Twitter posts</a> for the <a href="http://turing.cool/">Turing incomplete</a> podcast</li>
<li>a new programming language called <a href="http://www.ziglang.org">Zig</a></li>
<li>useful and tiny website <a href="http://www.ismytrainfucked.com">ismytrainfucked.com</a></li>
<li>a game with Google ngrams dataset "Word Freq"</li>
<li><a href="http://boustro.com/app">an app</a> for <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Boustrophedon">buostrofying</a> text</li>
<li>a JavaScript application of spreadsheets called <a href="https://github.com/gmarceau/spread.js">spread.js</a></li>
<li>visualisation of NYC violations by precinct</li>
<li>simulation of the way colourblind see the world, to help designers create better products</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JonHMChan/descartes">Descartes</a> - CSS written in JS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I don't think I'll be able to not do any side projects, as I won a book - <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022657.do"><i>Kinect Hacks - Tips &amp; Tools for Motion and Pattern Detection</i></a>. I'm having some wild ideas about working with videos of Ginger.

<p>
After a quiet weekend at the RC, focusing today was much harder than expected. Thankfully, I already have some daily habits and starting the day with them helps me with unproductiveness and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
In terms of my main project, I haven't done much, but I'm planning to have a pairing session with Rose on Wednesday and do some research and work before that.
</p>
<p>
Gerald Sussman (the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT and Board Member of the Free Software Foundation) visited RC today and had a guest lecture on flexible systems in the evening. I must admit I haven't heard about him before RC. I admire his passion and skills, I think some people my age lack this kind of direction and focus.
</p>
<p>
As I didn't feel secure enough to say anything remotely interesting for him, I asked about his views on online education and some book recommendations for learning more about AI. I've also managed to ask a question after the lecture and got a pretty inspiring answer:
<blockquote>I want to enhance the lives of people who are having fun programming, not because it's a job they do, but because they want to think, and they want to learn by writing programs that help them think</blockquote>
<br />
I'm going to write more about the lecture itself later on, but I first need to wrap my mind around it.

<p>
Most of today was about having some leisure time, but I've managed to do the daily habits I've developed at the RC so far. I needed to work on the algorithms course, as I was far behind other group members. In between I also found the time to read some "Gödel, Escher, Bach" - a book I've wanted to read for a few years now and never got to it. I also bought "The Elements of Style", as I've heard is quite popular in the US to read it in college - I want to work on my writing.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow's going to be productive.

<li>first board-game design session with Tanoy</li>
<li>failed shopping turned into a successful trip</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Today I've learned how post-it notes and a few hours can be used for an awesome afternoon. I've finally had my first board-game design session with Tanoy.
</p>
<p>
The game theme is sailing in a small boat through open and dangerous seas. First we did some brainstorming, while munching cookies, and after we've been happy with the initial ideas we got down to prototyping. Making the tiny boats, board and all kinds of tokens made it suddenly very real.
</p>
<p>
The main takeout from today is that we need to play the game and adjust, rather than just talk about concepts and get more and more excited. Next session will probably happen next week and, if everything goes well, we'll soon create prototypes to play them with other RCers.
</p>
<p>
This game is supposed to be mainly a case study for game design, so I can learn to do it better. But if something cute and fun happens on the way, then it's even more worth it.
</p>
<p>
As for the failed shopping - I wanted to buy shoes, as I've managed to break a pair during yesterday's karaoke. I ended up getting a big mug and two books.

<p>
Today was mostly about bonding.
</p>
<p>
After starting the day right with meditation, pairing with <b>Vaibhav</b> and <b>Isla</b> during the refactoring dojo was a wonderful experience. We did the <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata">Tennis Refactoring Kata</a> in Python - worked together on purposely bad code in a way that didn't break the tests, but helped with understanding the underlying logic of the program.
</p>
<p>
Later we planned for a short meeting of the algorithms course group and ended up spending more than an hour together, crunching problem sets.
</p>
<p>
After a quick mini-session on Google Analytics with Jade, I went out for late lunch with a bunch of people, to also spend some time with Emil on his last day of residency at RC. After we got back, we've had an exciting code jeopardy (which <b>Vaibhav</b> ruled, I think he must've devoured Wikipedia). Short chat about karaoke revealed an existing RC karaoke app and that's when we found the box labeled "karaoke". A few hours later, extremely tired and very happy we went our separate ways, to get some sleep after an awesome night.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, the setup was professional - we were using a projector, two mics, a disco-ball and a big chunk of the floor to dance while singing.

</p>

<p>
This was the most intense day at RC so far. From the check-in at 10:30am until the end of presentations at 6:30pm I've had only two short breaks.
</p>
<h4>NLP workshop</h4>
<p>
The NLP workshop was more theoretical than I expected, focusing on efficient way to represent probabilities. I'd love to get to the nitty-gritty of the implementation for parts of speech tagging, but it was still quite a useful setup for thinking about language processing.
</p>
<h4>Code retreat</h4>
<p>
For the code retreat we did pair-programmed, test-driven Game of Life in four runs. My coding partners were (I guess "J" was the letter of the day):
<ul>
<li><b>Jade</b> for the initial Python look at the problem, with extremely detailed unit tests, which was a great starting point,</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> for a little bit more broad approach to it in Ruby, which taught me a lot about best practices in a very short time,</li>
<li><b>James</b> for the second try in Python, this time trying it with sub-matrices and using the "neighbourhood" of a cell as a starting point,</li>
<li><b>Juliano</b> for some playtime with Elixir - we've had a great time pairing earlier this week, but today we were both way too tired to implement the problem or even recognise syntax problems.</li>
</ul>
The approach for the exercise was doing it test-first and throwing away the code after a pairing session. The rules for each one were:
<ul>
<li>ping-pong TDD - one person writes the test, the other one implementation and the next test, then the first one has to implement etc.,</li>
<li>3 line limit on methods,</li>
<li>no primitive data types (focusing on expressing in problem domain terms),</li>
<li>no conditional statements/no speaking (the second one could've been used as an additional constraint for some languages, as it's sometimes natural to not use conditional statements).</li>
</ul>
I would love to write more about the code retreat, but I feel I need a few days to think about all the benefits of it and reevaluate my strategy before the next one (because, obviously, there has to be a next one).
</p>
<h4>Goal-setting workshop</h4>
<p>
The goal-setting workshop was a surprisingly successful short exercise. We worked in groups of three, working on one person's goals at a time. First they would present their focus for the RC, achievements to date and possible problems that are holding them back. Then the other members of the group would discuss it briefly without the involvement of the presenter and at the end of focus mini-session they'd have some time to reflect on the insights.
</p>
<p>
I was pleasantly surprised how optimistic <b>David</b> and <b>Sofia-Jeanne</b> were about my goals and focus. The cute thing we did at the end of the workshop were paper cranes with our goals hidden inside, so we can unfold them at the end of our batch.
</p>
<p>
During the workshop we were also introduced to the concept of Test Driven Learning, which I think deserves a separate blog post as soon as I find some time.
</p>
<h4>Presentations</h4>
<p>
Presentations today were awesome (as usual), the ones I especially liked were:
<ul>
<li><b>Loraine's</b> approach to ethical engineering of self-driving cars (hilarious in a bit disturbing way)</li>
<li><b>James's</b> summary of the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fast_inverse_square_root">fast inverse square root</a> problem</li>
<li><b>Michelle's</b> cute little JS app I don't think she gave herself enough credit for</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
After so many adventures I went for a huge poke bowl with <b>Juliano</b> to a very nice place called Simple (some photos below).

Achievements:
<ul>
<li>check-in</li>
<li>keeping the meditation habit streak</li>
<li>warm-ups in Python</li>
<li>productive meeting with Emil on my workflow</li>
<li>pairing with Spencer on audio comparison in Python</li>
<li>learning how to use Jupyter notebooks, thanks to Joe</li>
<li>interesting discussion on code quality and team workflows</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
Thinking about and reviewing my workflow with Emil today helped me reframe it from "this thing I should do perfectly to be a better programmer" to "a habit that helps me with my work". Sometimes the simplest things can help a lot.
</p>
<p>
Pairing with Spencer on audio was challenging, as I have only vague knowledge of audio processing and analysis, which my basic understanding of Python didn't help with. I got the sense of direction and next steps I want to do Saturday-ish, as Spencer agreed to do some work on it remotely.
</p>
<p>
Using a new tool can be confusing, so I got loads of help from Joe on how to use Jupyter notebooks. I find them very cool and useful for my Python &amp; CS learning.
</p>
<p>
Being at RC allows you to make mistakes openly and simply ask for help, even if you feel your problems are dumb or basic.
</p>
<p>
Also, turns out some people unexpectedly speak Polish - Emil surprised me with his skills during lunch. Kudos, I can't imagine learning a language that hard just because my spouse speaks it.
</p>
<p>
I'm still on my way to peak learning and productivity, so things are going to get more interesting.

</p>

<p>
They are very light and the perfect shade of purple. 3D printing is a great art tool and I'll be hopefully trying it next week during the arts and crafts night.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to purchase a pair, you can either ask me to buy them here or go to Jade's website - <a href="http://www.cofactordesigns.com">cofactordesigns.com</a>. A few vibrant colours are available.

<p>
Learning a new programming language can be challenging and the best way to do it is just jumping right into it. That's why I've spent 3+ hours pair programming with Juliano in Elixir, to implement <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> Turing machine.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, we've had a meeting to watch some Destroy All Software videos and I've managed to learn some algorithms.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is going to be better still, as I'm planning to get home before 10pm and get some much needed rest.

<p>
Pair programming is one of the best parts of the RC experience. Today I jumped into Python, although I never really enjoyed it. Also managed to schedule two new pair programming sessions this week - one in Python on audio and language recognition, one on the Turing machine with Elixir and Brainfuck.
</p>
<p>
One of the Recursers is planning on doing a 3D printing workshop and we came up with a few ideas for the arts and crafts night with his printer.
</p>
<p>
All in all, it just keeps getting better.

<p>
Setting up a meditation habit at 9:30 and doing it in a group makes it much easier to be at the RC on time. After a short session and breakfast, the trip was a great next step.
</p>
<p>
Sunday was a surprisingly packed day at the RC, with most Recursers trying some form pair programming. I wouldn't know much about it, since a bean bag in the quiet room turned out to have some sort of a spell on it and I slept most of the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Jin (Joe) from RC was kind enough to set up a meeting with his friend Jae, who works at Accenture. I'm still not sure about my next career step, so getting an honest opinion about it was pretty useful.
</p>
<p>
Turned out I was drinking an old-lady's drink - misugaru latte, a bean-based sweet treat with ice.
</p>
<p>
On my way back I did a very tourist thing - took a photo of the Empire State Building.</p>

I was the first to come and the last to go today. Saturday is the "real" weekend at RC, there was nearly nobody here. Apart from the very few people who don't have AC or have cockroaches at their Airbnbs.
</p>
<p>
Peaceful and productive.

Weekends at the RC start on Fridays. It's a time for some alone work and focus, or just walking around NYC and doing all the tourist stuff.
</p>
<p>
Even so, there were so many people here during the day, there was hardly any space left.

Starting the day right with the morning meditation and a sensible check-in helped with my focus. Got three hours of work before the study groups meetings kicked-in.

<p>
RC is a great place for random encounters. One person turns out to be selling cool Pythagorean Theorem earrings (as soon as I get mine will share pics), another designs board games and agrees to a random workshop on the topic. Philosophical discussions, business ideas, board games and pizza - perfect night in a perfect place.

I've spent most of the day on errands, as apparently the US banking system is very different. Should you ever wish to use an European debit card, be amused, as some ATMs and shops will accept it, and some others will treat is as a credit card. Which means you need to provide an American ZIP-code you don't have.
</p>
<p>
With my flow broken I've spend most of the evening acquiring data for my app, as it was a tedious but simple thing. Tomorrow I can start with first UI drafts and API integration.

It is very easy to get distracted at the RC. Everybody is doing something new and exciting, many people are feeling overwhelmed.
The first day was mostly about getting around the space, whilst the second is about settling and being more comfortable. Knowing where you're going for lunch or how to use the coffee grinder. Getting into the rhythm of morning check-ins, warmups and daily pair programming.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow I'm planning for more alone time, as I'm finally out of the rut and have some ideas on the first steps for my big project.

          <p>The Recurse Center is a very welcoming and open place I'm going to spend 90% of my time at. Not just because it's what I came here to do, but also because I love it.</p>
<p>I've met a ton of people:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Joseph</b> from LA, who's into data science and bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Isla</b>, a mathematician from Scotland who's also into bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Paul</b> from Ireland, who has a PhD in compilers and runs his own business</li>
<li><b>Satabdi</b>, a Bengali girl who wants to work on her functional programming</li>
<li><b>Zach</b>, a programmer for RC who advised me on how to deal with cockroaches and actually considers them a NYC thing</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, an Australian who loves her JavaScript</li>
<li><b>Leah</b> of Bellevue, who wants to go through a statistics textbook</li>
<li><b>Trey</b> from California, who is in his second batch to have some time for himself between jobs</li>
<li><b>David</b>, who doesn't use his Korean name and wants to build an SMT-solver</li>
<li><b>Lisa</b>, a facilitator from Texas who loves her Android</li>
<li><b>Amy</b> Pickup, whose surname I love, wants to build web apps</li>
<li><b>Vaibhav</b>, an Indonesian guy who's into Haskell</li>
<li><b>Alicia</b>, in love with healthcare and Python</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> of Peru, who wants to play with Erlang and Elixir</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, who's done so many things I can't even imagine pair programming with her</li>
<li><b>Ivan</b>, a Russian who wants to experiment with data science, among a ton of other things</li>
<li><b>Miguel</b>, another Haskell enthusiast from Colombia</li>
<li><b>Katherine</b>, a biologist who loves her Python and Vim</li>
<li><b>Lareine</b> from New Jersey, a very shy girl who has a lot to offer, especially with Arduino</li>
<li><b>Leeor</b> from Israel, a lawyer who turned to coding</li>
<li><b>Ivo</b>, a quiet web-dev from Lima</li>
<li><b>James</b>, a backend programmer turned RC facilitator from NY</li>
<li><b>?</b> from Mid-West, an geologist who does web dev and digs data science</li>
<li><b>Sean</b>, a graduate student in linguistics and language perception</li>
<li><b>Ginger</b>, a mix of a maltese and a poodle (maltipoo), who's just the cutest dog ever</li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the people I've talked (or played with in case of Ginger) at least for a few minutes. Altogether I've met about thrice as much.</p>
<p>On one hand, the first day was relaxing. We did introductions, first check-ins, lunch, developer speed-dating, some quiet time and a meetup.</p>
<p>On the other, reiterating my story with new people every few minutes was exhausting. I'm not sure I even know what I've said to most of them. Loads of new ideas, but also insecurity, as I don't know where to start.</p>
