                <id>https://trueskawka.github.io/blog/programming/rc/2017/11/04/single-div-CSS-animations</id>
                <content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/blog/programming/rc/2017/11/04/single-div-CSS-animations.html">&lt;p&gt;I recently got inspired to try pure CSS single div
animations, as I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; (thank you, Gabrielle!).
There were only two problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can’t draw&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t know enough about CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed impossible to tackle without a lot of
effort, so I’ve been putting it off, until I
realized the more I think about it, the harder it
gets. I decided this is more of a learning
challenge than it is a problem. Would I ever be able to draw well enough to be a designer? I don’t think so. Would I be able to have fun creating a small project from time to time and see improvements? I betcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I usually approach learning a new programming concept?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I read about it and find a tangible example&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I look around the example and break it in a controlled way,
 to make sure I understand what happens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I come up with a small enough problem of my own that uses
the concept I want to learn and keep the example as reference,
googling for other ideas and suggestions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I incorporate the concept into other projects, to make sure
I understand it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the animations, I decided there are a few key factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to make them cute, so that I’ll share them and get
 encouraged to create more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to write quality code, not just make them look good&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’d like to be able to plan my approach before coding, either
by drawing them by hand or breaking into building blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-cant-draw&quot;&gt;I can’t draw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I work on my laptop, the less I write, so my
handwriting went from cute tiny letters to
barely legible tiny squiggles. And even though I can draw a
passable cat (meaning - my youngest sister can identify it as a
cat without much trouble), I don’t think I can draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the initial experiment, I decided to explore what makes
for a cute cat. I looked for various tutorials and thought of
a few key features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pointy ears, usually a bit rounded&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cute little nose, sometimes heart-shaped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;big eyes, with or without snake-like pupils&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tiny mouth, often smiling or meowing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whiskers, usually 2 or 3 on each side&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oval or rounded head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then explored them on paper, to get a better grasp of what I
need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos-trueskawka/photos/blog/cat_exploring_final.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I worked to recreate &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/johanmouchet/pen/OXxvqr&quot;&gt;this cute cat
animation&lt;/a&gt;
and it sort of, kind of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/trueskawka/pen/zPYXLM&quot;&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt;. Granted,
it’s not my own design and I didn’t fully understand what was
happening with some parts of it, but I’ve learned to decompose
an image and then translate it into basic shapes, colors
and layers. Also, it wasn’t yet a single div image - but I was
getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/cat.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cat-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;cat&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;ear ear-left&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;ear ear-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;head&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;eye eye-left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;pupil&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;eye eye-right&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;pupil&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;muzzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-dont-know-enough-about-css&quot;&gt;I don’t know enough about CSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I know enough CSS to create websites and
work on HTML email templates (which require you to write CSS
like it’s 2004), but I’ve never gone into more intricate
styling techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, I am not a designer and designers usually provide me
with either images or relatively simple UIs to code. It
doesn’t make much sense to use CSS images in a production
environment - who has the time to write and review them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But CSS seems like a good medium for me to draw - I can build
on basic shapes as I deconstruct images and the examples are
reproducible (which I can’t yet say about my hand-drawn
images).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for more examples and came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dotconferences.com/2016/12/wenting-zhang-make-css-your-secret-super-drawing-tool&quot;&gt;this
talk&lt;/a&gt;
by Wenting Zhang. I decided to follow along with the tutorial and
create a simple mustache animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/mustache.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mustache-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;mustache&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great exercise, as it taught me a bit more about
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt;, most importantly, that there is no limit on the
number of shadows and they can be moved around, stretched and
recolored. It also helped me start treating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt; pseudoelements as layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to create a few more animations, trying to
get a good grasp of how I should divide my images between
those layers. It turns out there is a lot of flexibility with
shadows, but reshaping is not their strongest feature - they
mostly stay the same shape as the initial layer and, although
they can be manipulated with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/code&gt;, since I wanted
more than a few basic shapes in my drawings, I needed to learn
more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I could now create pretty complex shapes with three
layers and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;box-shadows&lt;/code&gt;, like this animation of the Recurse
Center logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/rc.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;rc-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;rc&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating shapes with a single div is sometimes quite
challenging and can use all three layers (the div, its
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt;). One a tad more complex shape I wanted
to use was a chevron, in order to create a simple animation of
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xfive.co/&quot;&gt;Xfive&lt;/a&gt; logo, similar to the one on
their website, but created with pure CSS. For this I needed to
learn and understand gradients better, so I turned to the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do&quot;&gt;CSS Secrets&lt;/a&gt;
book - after doing a few exercises, I felt ready to create
multiple gradient layers and mix them up with pseudoelements
and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/x5.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;x5-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;x5&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to further improve both my drawing and CSS skills. I’m
planning to do a bigger project soon, but for now I’ll try to
do a few CSS animations a week - you can check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/trueskawka/css-drawings&quot;&gt;GitHub
repository&lt;/a&gt; for
the animations’ code and my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/trueskawka/&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt; to view them (along
with some bits and pieces from various old projects).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                <published>2017-01-31T16:15:00+01:00</published>
                <updated>2017-01-31T16:15:00+01:00</updated>
                <id>https://trueskawka.github.io/blog/programming/rc/2017/01/31/return-programmer</id>
                <content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/blog/programming/rc/2017/01/31/return-programmer.html">&lt;p&gt;24 weeks ago I entered the Recurse Center in New York, not sure what to
expect. I’ve only known what I was able to find online and anything I could
gather from introductory emails. I flew to another continent based on the gut
feeling that this is the right thing to do and not being able to explain
what &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expectations&quot;&gt;Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have submitted my RC application on a whim when life didn’t feel quite where
I wanted it to be in March last year. It was surprisingly easy to answer
two core questions on the application form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-you-want-to-be-doing-in-two-years&quot;&gt;What do you want to be doing in two years?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to work with people who are smarter than me and learn.
I want to have a remote job that allows me to travel and work.
I want to make products that suit the users’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-you-want-to-attend-the-recurse-center&quot;&gt;Why do you want to attend the Recurse Center?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to kick-off and have a new start.
For the last few years I’ve been an analyst/programmer/whatever-is-needed
and I didn’t really have a clear idea on what I want to do.
Going abroad for a few months and creating something from scratch sounds
like a great idea to finally start being a full-time programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I’m not that surprised I got in, even though when I first
got my acceptance email a month later I was shocked. (&lt;em&gt;Me? The person who
couldn’t even code a proper recursive FizzBuzz?&lt;/em&gt;) The answers above are
very much in RC-spirit, even though I’m not sure I can pin down what that
means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recurse Center is primarily and predominantly about people. It’s not
just a space where we can hang out all the time (sometimes literally days
at a time), with WiFi, beanbags and coffee. A co-working space or a start-up
office doesn’t quite describe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a place where you can always find someone to talk to and ask any
question. When you get to spend time with someone, they are fully engaged
in the conversation, whether it’s helping you find a fairly straightforward
typo in your code, learning a new paradigm together, late-night discussions
or listening just because you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a community where you can make friends nearly instantaneously.
Sure, not everyone is going to be your bestie - after all, without diversity
it would be a very boring community. When you meet the people you resonate
with, it’s like a first date - time flies as you end up talking about anything
and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily check-ins and check-outs to motivate and discuss problems,
building projects together and attending workshops, morning meditation,
group sightseeing and hiking, arcade games, drinks, karaoke… It’s a big
and lively community, with something to suit everyone’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space&quot;&gt;Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of light, thanks to huge windows and a pretty big central
space. There are rooms where one could hide should there be too much noise
from people discussing, lunching and enjoying each others’ company. Beanbags
and coffee mugs are everywhere, as are programming books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RC has a good balance between having enough space for tens of people at a
time and still being warm and cozy. Sometimes one has to wait for
the “perfect” spot to work or make sure they come early enough to get the
big coffee mug. Sometimes it’s overcrowded in a friendly way during
community events like presentations or job fairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always a welcoming space, even though it’s ever-changing and adjusting
to the needs of every new batch. It’s also always open, so it’s easy enough
to fit everyone’s schedule, whether an early bird or extreme night owl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning&quot;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning as an adult is hard. Everything seems to be more important than
your personal growth right at this very moment. It doesn’t give you
immediate benefits, it requires a lot of work and dedication. It’s easy
enough to understand that someone wants to travel or just have a nice
evening out with friends. But there’s nothing glamorous or instantly
gratifying in sitting down and going through the complicated algorithm or
learning German grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RC is self-motivated and self-paced. The freedom is overwhelming. There are
no constraints, apart from the vague deadline of the end of batch. Everyone
there wants to learn, which makes it easier, but also extremely hard - how
can you feel you’re growing enough when someone else is doing way more
interesting things, even though you’ve put in the work every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the need to be honest with oneself. To know when you got lost
or the path you’ve chosen was not the right one. To tell yourself “I’m going
to try, even though this can turn out to be a mistake” and to admit “I was
mistaken, because I didn’t know enough”. Most importantly, it’s about keeping
oneself motivated and asking “what can I learn from this?”. After all, you
often can’t tell if something is going to be the right thing before you try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to RC, I wanted to learn all the things. I ended up learning things I
didn’t think I needed, which were usually not the things I’ve planned for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-us&quot;&gt;The US&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my very first time in the US and I didn’t expect it would be much
different from Europe. After all, I’ve been to places and seen things. Also,
&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; knows the American culture - the movies, the music, the never-ending
broadcast on everything American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I can see some pretty significant changes in my approach, many of which
were triggered by or learned from my American(ized) friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t care what people think until I do. Walking around New York it
doesn’t matter that much how you look or what you are wearing, which is
something I’ve always been self-conscious about. I gained freedom to focus
on the important relationships, not worry about what could be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried and failed a lot. Got up and failed again. Thanks to my newly
gained freedom from judgment, I’ve learned to try while I believe there is
a purpose to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned to be more open. Coming up with a smile and talking to
strangers is the new normal. As is being open about money and expecting a fair
remuneration for one’s efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I challenge whining, especially my own rambling and negativity. It still
happens more often than I’d like, but each time I’m getting better at turning
things around and focusing on solutions rather than problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I embrace my inner introvert and preferred working hours. I no longer feel
guilty about not being a morning person or having &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; days, when I’d rather
just work instead of talking to people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I came in on a sunny Monday morning, I immediately embarrassed
myself by confusing some minor organizational thing. I then ran for the
coffee, trying to hide with half of a croissant and the overwhelming feeling
of being out of place. I was scared nobody will be able to understand my
accent. I was terrified I won’t be able to match their programming skills
and that by the end of the first week someone would politely ask me to go
back home and stop pretending I belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been welcomed with all my flaws and encouraged to embrace the obstacles,
real or imagined. I tend to talk about my life pre- and post-RC, because this
has been a transformative experience for me. I know how to grow and adjust
it to my needs. I’ve learned some things I hope future-me will keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time and attention are the most valuable resources you can give and receive.
The more of those we share with each other, the better our world is going to
be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having an “a-ha” moment together is the most magical experience. Whenever
possible, try to grow or help grow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honor all forms of progress. Your friend is doing it all wrong, learning
Python instead of falling head over heels into Haskell? You don’t think
anyone could ever be a good programmer without a CS degree? Let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t force yourself. I forced myself to get up in the morning and fit into
other people’s schedule. I forced myself to try things I didn’t feel like doing.
I forced myself to work on something I publicly said I would, even though I’ve
realized early on it doesn’t spark joy. If forcing yourself, it’s probably
time to change something.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do things your own way. I thought I needed to do “proper” pair programming, but
what I really needed was to have someone care about what I do and ask me the
right questions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No regrets. There are so many people you can meet and work with, no way
you’re going to do something with all of them. And that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exhausting, it was wonderful. New York might not be the place where
I’d like to live, but it’s definitely a place I want to keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;

                <id>https://trueskawka.github.io/zulip/outreachy/gci/blog/2017/01/12/how-i-grow</id>
                <content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/zulip/outreachy/gci/blog/2017/01/12/how-i-grow.html">&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been an ongoing adventure for me - an adventure in
learning to manage the &lt;em&gt;disorienting level of freedom&lt;/em&gt; I’ve had to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound ridiculous - after all, many dream of having enough time
for learning and growing. For focusing on whatever they want, not on what
they are told to. Especially for programmers, it seems like a dream come
true - a few months of working for the pure pleasure of it and contributing
to open-source projects? Count me in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been great. I have never been this happy. To wake up every day and feel
this is what I want to do, to think of code and in code with excitement.
I sometimes still feel not good or smart or experienced enough, but I never
feel it was the wrong choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, and…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and it’s very hard to stay on track. After all, programming
is full of opportunities - every day there are new libraries, patches,
languages and amazing projects created by someone on the Internet. It may
seem that there is never enough time to learn and the endless possibilities
can become suffocating. It’s extremely hard to stay creative when having
total freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that I’ve had to learn more about myself and what rules and
habits I need to set up for myself to keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-term-satisfaction-vs-long-term-happiness&quot;&gt;Short-term satisfaction vs. long-term happiness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always easy to do simple, well-defined tasks. But apart from the
short-term satisfaction of ticking it off my to-do list or sharing my
progress publicly, there is not much else to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be happy I need to do hard things. Untangle ill-defined and
fuzzy problems, navigate and unwrap spaghetti legacy code while implementing
a new feature - that’s what keeps me going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to have some easy wins on my to-do list, but they can’t take it
over. Working towards the long-term goal every day, regardless of my
motivation level, should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-inspiration&quot;&gt;Sources of inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get inspired all the time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My inbox is full of newsletters and emails on programming, design, and
MOOCs I’d like to take part in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I answer many questions every day, ranging from workflow skills, through
basic programming concepts and specific language issues, to intricate
problems I’m sometimes not sure I even understand. This makes me
constantly search for answers by using a lot of googling, skimming docs
and StackOverflow, but also through asking the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussing any topic in the two realms I’m a user of can be a first step
to an hours-long or even all-night journey into a world of new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reviewing submissions and reading others’ code inspires my to constantly
question my skills and look for answers - how did they do that? what’s
the issue here? how do I even…?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playing boardgames. The hardest time I’ve had recently with switching
my creative mode off was after two hours of playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit&quot;&gt;Dixit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s wonderful to learn new things in a wide range of topics. Managing
incoming inspirations and keeping myself from multitasking is a challenge.
Which is evident even from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Reading-list-first-month-FqGUhYlpF1iUQx2FnbaGe&quot;&gt;list of articles&lt;/a&gt;
that inspired me to grow as a programmer in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gathering-scattered-thoughts&quot;&gt;Gathering scattered thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried many approaches for managing the influx of information and my
creative output. At the moment I use a simple system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habitica.com/&quot;&gt;Habitica&lt;/a&gt; for daily tasks and my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.one-tab.com/&quot;&gt;OneTab&lt;/a&gt; to convert my tabs into a list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A plethora of text files scattered around multiple folders to note
incoming waves of ideas and save any emails or messages I
particularly liked. They mainly consist of various lists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have been using GitHub and other tools when working with others,
I haven’t found a better approach to managing my own workflow. I’ve tested
many until I realized I’m spending more time on improving productivity
than being productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-grow&quot;&gt;How to grow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set boundaries and a simple enough system that works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Have regular focused time and a dedicated space, even if that space is
putting your laptop on your lap. Don’t lose your focus on distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on your communication.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Listen attentively and be fully in the moment whenever you decide to
talk to someone. Try to understand other perspectives and think of them
when communicating your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get distracted in a controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When it’s time to focus, try to eliminate distractions. If you can’t turn
off notifications, allows yourself to quickly assess their importance.
Take note of anything you want to investigate later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teach.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can rarely be sure you know something before you explain it to
someone else. Teaching is an opportunity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;disorienting level of freedom&lt;/em&gt; is directly cited from Allison
Kaptur’s talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcc6JEhDSpo&quot;&gt;effective learning strategies for programmers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great talk to watch!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, and…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the most
important rule of improvisational theatre. Should you ever get a chance to
try improv, go for it! It was one of the best experiences during my batch at
the Recurse Center.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

                <id>https://trueskawka.github.io/zulip/outreachy/gci/blog/2017/01/11/outreachy-first-month-recap</id>
                <content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/zulip/outreachy/gci/blog/2017/01/11/outreachy-first-month-recap.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked today to reflect on my first Outreachy month and share
what I’ve done so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;initial-proposal&quot;&gt;Initial proposal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit I’ve felt queasy about it at first - after
all, my initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Outreachy-proposal-QfwrTnnGBDBd9hBGCyUjT&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;
was full of ambitious goals that were to be driven by the regular expected
levels of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That didn’t happen. I have made mistakes on the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I let my momentum get lost while visiting family for the better part of
November and it took time to regain it after I got back home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am still struggling with sharing imperfect code and contributions, even
though as a mentor I know their value.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got completely involved in the Google Code-In, because after the initial
stress of being inexperienced and unable to help the students, it became
easier and easier with every week to focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got used to my to-do list getting longer and longer, focusing more on
immediate tasks than long-term goals. It’s easier to tick off “create
a GCI task” than “implement this big and fuzzy issue”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it meant for my proposal - I haven’t worked on most of my planned tasks
when planned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSS splitting got behind the Zulip redesign and I was able to split
only one part since my pre-Outreachy splits, as everything else is in the
midst of changes and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building screenshots and improving Casper tests is still on my to-do list,
but the only steps I’ve taken so far is reading the Casper docs, tinkering
a bit with our Casper doc and refactoring the task into more actionable
steps earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My work on interactive bots was late, but since it was part of my GCI
responsibilities, I’ve managed to learn how to create bots and wrote the
tasks for them. Over the past few weeks I’ve also helped students work
on the bots and learned a lot from them (more on that later on).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked on issues related to stream flow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-have-been-working-on&quot;&gt;What I have been working on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contributions concerned mostly GCI improvements and communication, with
some minor work towards my general goals. I’ve found it much easier to
write and be social - respond to messages, review pull requests, help
students with tasks, create documents - than to focus on my own code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/tasks/interactive-bots.md&quot;&gt;interactive bots tasks&lt;/a&gt;
for the GCI students.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/tasks/translations.md&quot;&gt;translation tasks&lt;/a&gt; for
the GCI students and wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/2439&quot;&gt;initial Polish style guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have written a doc on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/docs/improving-gci-experience.md&quot;&gt;improving the GCI experience&lt;/a&gt;
as a reflection and a shared set of experiences. I have also written an
internal doc for mentors on encouraging students.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/2128&quot;&gt;split the right sidebar CSS&lt;/a&gt;
from the main &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zulip.css&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have had 3 GCI shifts a week for reviewing student submissions and
helping them on Zulip. I’ve also been helping students, posting various
reflections, and discussing issues and improvements quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also currently have multiple tasks in line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted a work-in-progress pull request on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/2721&quot;&gt;muted streams prompt&lt;/a&gt; that needs refactoring and
better testing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on building CSS linters after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/test.20suites/topic/linting&quot;&gt;fruitful chat with Steve&lt;/a&gt; [you
have to be logged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.zulip.org&quot;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt;]. I am also creating
a write-up of this discussion for further use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a React Native app &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/181&quot;&gt;issue assigned&lt;/a&gt; - so far I’ve a working
environment and I’ve tried to trigger the issue with no luck on my mobile
device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a draft write-up about Casper testing and will be improving the
existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing-with-casper.html&quot;&gt;Zulip Casper doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a few draft posts on mypy, open-source skills and improving as an
intermediate programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;actionable-goals&quot;&gt;Actionable goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next two months of my internship, I want to focus more on my own
contributions, especially putting my coding skills to good use. Google
Code-In is ending soon, which will free up my schedule and prevent me from
focusing entirely on mentoring. Alas, I need some actionable goals, since
my initial proposal was too vague and I got easily distracted with better
defined tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will refactor each of the tasks currently in line (and any future task)
and split them into smaller, better defined ones, with more specific
deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will check in daily, as it’s much harder to be vague when informing
others what I’ve been up to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will set aside time for big picture ideas on possible enhancements and
creative writing on non-technical aspects of software development and I
will be focused on the task at hand outside of those intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will follow a more regular schedule instead of working in irregular
intervals of varied lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>
