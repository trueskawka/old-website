&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;met a ton of new people today&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;watched community presentations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lost and regained a friend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;did a mob coding session&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;watched presidential debate with friends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had a lot of quality time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of the Fall 2 2016 batch. It was amazing to meet all those new people, ready for their RC experience. It also told us a lot about our first day - we were as utterly lost and confused as we thought we were. I hope our batch can be as great guides for the newcomers, as Summer 2s were for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a friendship scare today - there was a serious risk of Cihan going back home and I actually thought it’s going to happen most of the day. I wasn’t surprised it moved me - after all, he’s one of my best friends here and it was so sudden, I expected to have six more weeks of coding and bonding. Fortunately, it turned out to be ‘only’ a scare, that got me to also bond with a lot of people. It’s surprising how close one can get to a person in such a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the sadness, I’ve managed to have a pretty cool mob coding session with Sarah, Leah, James and Chris. We build together a working implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/trueskawka/8667b12d4552c4ca46b6f79fb195c78d&quot;&gt;Hangman&lt;/a&gt; in about half an hour (mostly thanks to the mad skills of the Python experts in the group). It was fun, next time we could focus more on actual pairing and not ‘mob coding’ as such - we did a lot of thinking together and it was a bit chaotic. Looking forward to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was an unusual Monday, because we’ve had some presentations. As there were only five of them, I think it’s just appropriate to mention them all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;V talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://vaibhavsagar.com/duffer/&quot;&gt;duffer&lt;/a&gt; - his implementation of git in Haskell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marcio did a short introduction for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marciok/SwiftyRuby&quot;&gt;SwiftyRuby&lt;/a&gt; - a way to use Ruby in Swift&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Andy, as hilarious as always, talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simplyshredded.com/oak-roots-how-arnold-turned-his-biggest-weakness%C2%97-his-calves-into-a-showcase-muscle.html&quot;&gt;Schwarzenegger’s calfs&lt;/a&gt;, in the context of his programming pop-quiz project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michelle presented her awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://i17on.com/&quot;&gt;intranationalization engine&lt;/a&gt; in Markdown and I want to pair with her on my app project, right after I pair with Nick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satabdi live coded &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/satabdidas/RC_Notes/blob/65121c40b26e84a77ddc1c980e2829e9e838ad95/notes/quest_of_deep_c/tiny_elf_execs.md&quot;&gt;tiny ELF executables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the events and talks, we all needed some alone time. At 9pm we watched the presidential debate in a side room, as to not make an official event out of it - after all politics can be a bit overwhelming for the community. It was great to see reactions of my friends, especially American ones, who do understand a lot more of it than I do. I was still very moved by it and spent a lot of time discussing it afterwards (yes, I know it was supposed to be about more pairing, but today was a social day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, quality time dominated most of the day and I’m very happy - about new and old friends, discussions, bonding and Nutella. Yes, indulgences were on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 42</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/27/RC-day-42.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 42" /><published>2016-09-27T01:30:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T01:30:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/27/RC-day-42</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/27/RC-day-42.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;got new headphones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;found an apartment for the next two weeks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had an awesome evening with RC women&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;found out what my RC pseudonym is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loved ones took most of the day today, as I spent a lot of time on Skype. It has become sort of a routine to call them at least once a week and whenever I have Internet access, I can’t miss them too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got bargain noise-cancelling over-ear headphones, which makes me very happy - bye, bye headphone headaches. I’m now completely surrounded by music and silence to work. I’ve also found a new place to stay after my current sublet. Both thanks to RC community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I’ve spent some time with other RC women from our and the upcoming batches. All women meetings should be more of a thing, especially in the tech community. I do miss all the women in my life a lot and it helps to have new friendships here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we apply to RC, we get automatically generated pseudonyms to reduce bias (more on this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/blog/43-building-a-better-and-more-diverse-community&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post by Nick). Mine is totally awesome - Feature Fog. I can’t wait to use it in a programming context soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 41</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-41.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 41" /><published>2016-09-24T23:41:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-24T23:41:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-41</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-41.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;got a lot of rest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reflected on my first six weeks at RC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;discovered my patronus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six weeks ago I came to NYC with a very vague idea of what I wanted to do specifically. There seemed to be so many things I wanted and ‘had’ to learn - algorithms, networking, CS, ‘proper’ programming (whatever that means), machine learning, better visualisations, APIs, audio processing etc. The list could go on and on, as for the first few days I was utterly distracted and lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the first half of my batch, I’ve tried and resigned from many things. I didn’t work enough on my ‘big’ project, I felt that some methods of learning or topics I wanted to learn do not resonate with me. I’ve been going to workshops, sometimes a few a day, trying to learn as much as possible. At the same time, I was constantly amazed by the degree of focus of some of my fellow batchers, especially those who came here for ‘only’ six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health scare last week was a wake-up call - I’ve been overworking myself, overdosing on the wonderful experience that is RC. Yes, it was great to get up every morning full of plans and with my to-do list bursting. To rush for my morning meditation and check-in, feeling like I’m moving forward. But I need to shift my focus and adjust my goals, otherwise I might lose my motivation altogether. After all, it’s all about never graduating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I have a few areas and goals to focus on, distilled from the vast universe of possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still want to build my language-learning app, a project I’ve spread into tiny tasks that are now somewhere near the end of my to-do list under an avalanche of ideas&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love talking to people and I’ve been doing a lot of that, but I want to talk more about programming, which means more pairing - at least part of it should be focused on pursuing my projects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shortlist of bigger projects:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;language-learning app (possible pairing on audio processing, APIs and web dev)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;learning React while building an app (I have some ideas I would like to work on, especially with Ivo)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;building my own Markdown editor, either web or for MacOS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;career goals:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;writing 10 professional blog posts by the end of my stay in the US&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;applying for the remote opportunity I’m excited about (but don’t want to write about it too much, as not to jinx it)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;having at least 2 interview prep sessions a week&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;productive procrastination:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;an ongoing list of shorter projects to learn specific programming skills&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;making small 3D printed prototypes for future DYIing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 hours a week for a non-programming learning project&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spending Sundays and most of Saturdays on sightseeing/socializing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the first half of my batch was a perspective-changing experience. I’ll work on the next six weeks to be even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than reflections, plans and rest, I’ve had a fun few minutes with discovering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pottermore.com/news/discover-your-patronus-on-pottermore&quot;&gt;my patronus on Pottermore&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently it’s a weasel, which doesn’t seem too far removed from a squirrel I’ve always imagined it to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 40</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-40.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 40" /><published>2016-09-24T22:52:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-24T22:52:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-40</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-40.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planned a mob coding session with James&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had a great algorithms prep with Taylor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;took part in Mike’s Internet protocols workshop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tweaked my setup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;played board games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day perfectly with Sean’s scones, I’ve had a productive short session with James on the mob coding for the new batch on Monday. We’ll try to code a working Hangman implementation in Python in 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first algorithms prep was great, I don’t think I could’ve had a better partner for that than Taylor. I worked on a fairly simple matrix problem first, with some helpful feedback from Taylor, and then he got to work on a simple-turned-complicated brain teaser. I will definitely try to have more prep over the next 6 weeks and with more challenging questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike’s Internet protocols workshop (alternatively known as sniffing the glue that holds the Internet together) was comprehensive and helpful. I look forward to the next 5 or so sessions ahead of us. Mike is a great teacher! He managed to make a not so interesting topic fascinating, with a lot of examples of real-world usage and further steps for learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I tweaked my setup a little bit, since some fellow Recursers had problems with reading my syntax highlighting during pairing. Too be fair, the tiny-tiny letters on my screen are not of much help either, but since there is a simple enough shortcut for that, I’m not going to change it just yet. My bash prompt welcomes me now with a little heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56085440/photos/other/bash_prompt.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed quite late at the RC, playing board games and solving problems in our apps (but mostly board games). I love the space so much, I sometimes wish I could just not sleep at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 39</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-39.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 39" /><published>2016-09-24T22:14:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-24T22:14:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-39</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/24/RC-day-39.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked with Jeni, Alicia and Satabdi on the sexism tracking app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abstract Salad Factory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MCed presentations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had fun at the farewell picnic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;walked through the Brooklyn Bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The productive part of the day was really short, since today we had a farewell picnic for the Summer 2 batch (who overlapped with us) and some of our fellow batchers from Fall 1, who came here only for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve managed to get some coding started on our sexism tracking app, pairing with Jeni on views. The Abstract Salad Factory helped me then with not feeling guilty about indulging myself during the presentations and the picnic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I volunteered to MC the presentations, i.e. being the master of ceremonies - introducing speakers and making sure everything works out. It was fun, albeit a bit stressful. I had to come up to every person that was presenting, interrupt their last touchups and make sure their laptops work with the projector, the loudspeakers won’t make everybody’s ears bleed and they have whatever they might need. Even though I’ve had a few missteps on the way, everything ran pretty smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentations themselves were hilarious, some of my favourites were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lareine’s implementation of ethical engineering algorithm, with some surprising turns on who “deserves” to live - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8yd8d0ynkw25oxx/Ethical%20Engineering.pptx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are some of her thoughts from the previous presentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jesse’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JesseRap/RoboDJ&quot;&gt;DJ app&lt;/a&gt;, on which he worked together with Taylor - it automatically mixes music, just as a DJ would&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michelle’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://i17on.com/&quot;&gt;intranationalization engine for Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, which she hilariously presented with examples of possible uses of filtering words in text (e.g. you might want your resume to be “tech” for some people, but “fun” for others)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Juan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhbabon/johnny_eight&quot;&gt;CHIP-8&lt;/a&gt; emulator, which he got to play pong!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to the Brooklyn Bridge park and had a few wonderful hours in the sun, eating snacks and playing some outdoor sports. I learned to throw the egghand (Americans would call it football), but I need to work on not getting hit in the face with it. Also, a squirrel was very into our cookies and she was very impatient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also tried an American burger for the very first time and the experience was a bit disturbing - it tasted like something twice deep-fried. Striving to have more NYC experiences, I went on a walk through Brooklyn Bridge, or rather was dragged through it with the help of Cihan and Joe. It is ver high and the sidewalk is made of wood, my fear of heights won’t let me forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked with Alicia, Jeni and Satabdi on the sexism-tracking app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brian’s workshop on RESTful API design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nick’s workshop on macOS development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;refactored my code with Cihan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;written niceties for fellow Recursers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty good feeling about our sexism-tracking app. It seems self-contained, pretty well planned and it will hopefully turn out to be useful - I’m especially up for doing a lot of data visualisation. The first session was mostly about setting up the environment and I went down the rabbit hole with the virtual environment, as it didn’t like to have a space in the path name for my app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian’s workshop on RESTful API design was concise and well planned, I’ll be using his notes shortly. Nick has provided us with such a vast amount of knowledge on macOS development, I’ll need to pair with him soon to wrap my mind around it. I’ve always wanted to have my own Markdown writing app, so it fits perfectly with my programming bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I didn’t feel productive enough, I’ve had an impromptu session of refactoring my JS calendar with Cihan. He’s a great pairing navigator - intimidating me into working on my code by sitting and waiting for me to answer my own questions (this was not sarcastic, he’s so much fun to work with!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also spent an hour on writing niceties for our fellow Recursers, whose (half-)batch is ending soon. It was wonderful to be able to share all the feelings and gratitude, but also sad to think they’ll be gone soon. Alas, you can never be truly gone from the RC community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over all, the day went pretty great, even though I didn’t make it for today’s experimental check-in. I didn’t plan for it, it’s just that yesterday evening I met Luna - an RC alumni - with whom I’ve spend a better part of three hours completely lost in conversation and didn’t get back to the apartment soon enough to wake up on time. I think it falls into the category of “first world problems” - I have so many amazing people to meet and talk to that I can’t find time to sleep or be productive enough. I’ve done it yet again during the day - an innocent conversation with John turned into a 1.5h+ experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 37</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/22/RC-day-37.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 37" /><published>2016-09-22T02:20:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-22T02:20:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/22/RC-day-37</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/22/RC-day-37.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned more about Django REST framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;V’s workshop on Git Internals in Git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;read a hilarious article on Ruby vs Python&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planned a mob coding session for the new batch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sexism-tracking app will be built in Django, I wanted to learn more about the REST framework. The RESTful API design workshop was moved till Wednesday, so I’ll probably work on it a little bit more during the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V had a cool workshop on Git internals done entirely in Git. I didn’t feel I knew enough to understand and appreciate it enough, but I’ll definitely go through it again as soon as I have some time to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUCwr1Y6bFI&quot;&gt;Emily’s presentation on Git&lt;/a&gt;, as I’ve heard it might be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I was mostly browsing and organising. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/ruby-vs-python-the-definitive-faq-5cb0046292be#.adrdav245&quot;&gt;hilarious article&lt;/a&gt; on Ruby vs Python made my evening. Following into Alicia’s footsteps, I’ve decided to do a mob coding session for the new batch on Monday and I’m still looking for just the right challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 36</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/20/RC-day-36.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 36" /><published>2016-09-20T00:20:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-20T00:20:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/20/RC-day-36</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/20/RC-day-36.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started the week right with experimental check-in group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paired with Ivan on improving blog loading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked on an app concept with Alicia, Isla and Juan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;took part in Lyn’s OpenGL workshop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;discussed my next portfolio + blog steps with Jeni&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had some inspiration for growing as a programmer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experimental check-in group is about accountability, so we’ve started the week with assigning each other a person to help us and someone we could help with their work. I got a lot of support from Jeni on my writing and discussed Aissam’s app with him (though I don’t feel I’ve helped him much).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also done the initial planning for our problem-tracking app - we’re going to set it up in Django and do the initial functionality in plain HTML + CSS, to be further improved with proper JS (we might even try a JS framework, though it seems like a lot of work for a tiny app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the OpenGL workshop brought some inspiration, but I’m afraid I don’t have enough time for it now, with all the career- and CS-focused tasks ahead. I have some ideas on my next career steps, but I need to clarify and commit to them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 35</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/18/RC-day-35.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 35" /><published>2016-09-18T23:45:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-18T23:45:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/18/RC-day-35</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/09/18/RC-day-35.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;got some more time off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finally went to Times Square&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wrote my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://trueskawka.github.io/blog/life/2016/09/18/first-20-hours.html&quot;&gt;“professional” blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was mostly about relaxing by playing with kittens, walking and organising. There was nearly nobody at RC, which meant I got a lot of space to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

As I have so much to learn and so little time (or at least so is my perception), the concept of spending just 20 hours on something and going from knowing nothing to performing noticeably well is appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One needs to forget the notion of 10.000 hours needed to master a skill. That is not to say that practicing for about 5 years as a full-time job won’t help in acquiring and mastering a skill, it’s simply that most of us don’t need to be experts in every field. Sometimes just the basic skill can get a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the concepts presented in the book reminded me of well-known economic ideas, among others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the law of diminishing returns - the more you learn, the less noticeable your progress (just as well as eating more and more chocolate won’t bring noticeable difference after the first half of the bar)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pareto principle - 20% of efforts bring 80% of returns (but those efforts have to be directed and deliberate)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s law - work will fill out all the time available (so shorter deadlines can be more productive)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely understanding and noticing these rules may not be enough to overcome them, so Josh goes on to present actionable steps for learning any skill. By ‘any skill’ he means ‘any skill that is important to you’. The first step is to choose a lovable subject and concentrate on one project at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, one needs to define a target performance. What does it mean for you to learn a skill? If you were to learn a language, do you want to be a communicative tourist during your summer holidays or have never-ending philosophical disputes? Do you want to play guitar at a campfire or be a rock star? Josh advices that it’s better to start small - when you can understand the basic concepts and perform simple tasks, you can then move on to more sophisticated notions. In order to be a rock star, you need to know how a guitar produces the sounds and how to strum it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to take the first steps, one can apply the rules of rapid skill acquisition, mainly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deconstructing&lt;/strong&gt; the desired skill into smallest possible subskills&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learning about each subskill&lt;/strong&gt; to practice intelligently and self-correct based on fast feedback loops&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;removing barriers&lt;/strong&gt; to learning
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;physical - acquiring the right tools (e.g. guitar, books) and setting aside time for practice (e.g. every day for 45 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;mental and emotional - setting oneself in a can-do mindset (e.g. I can learn this concept for the next 20 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practicing&lt;/strong&gt; mindfully and deliberately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constraining oneself further with practicing for just 20 hours or until the desired target performance is reached helps with avoiding the Parkinson’s law trap. Also, short-term results are usually the most rapid ones, as the function of skill to time is most steep at the very start. Hence one can get pretty good quickly and base motivation for their next steps on the already achieved success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrating on one skill for a short time has also the advantage of testing the idea. Do I really want to speak Spanish, or is it just something I feel I need to know? Is this something I want to spend more time on? Sometimes one can’t know their own preferences until they’ve properly tested their presumptions. After a short experiment, there is no harm in deciding not to follow up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, Josh goes on to describe how he acquired six new skills over the course of a year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;setting up a daily yoga routine&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;basic programming and building two applications&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;touch typing in Colemak&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;playing Go&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;playing ukulele&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;windsurfing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I don’t want to spoil the book, I’ll briefly describe the ukulele-playing chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would one go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obtaining an ukulele and other necessary equipment seems like a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning how it works (parts of the instrument, where does the sound come from etc.).
         &lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56085440/photos/blog/20hours/ukulele.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on learning four most common chords (they say you can play most pop songs with just G, D, Em and C).
         &lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56085440/photos/blog/20hours/chords.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When one can play the chords without looking, practicing until they can play them without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning to learn songs by humming along, then adding lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experimenting, e.g. learning fingerpicking and new chords.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never graduating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY&quot;&gt;watch Josh’s talk about these concepts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943&quot;&gt;buy his book&lt;/a&gt;.
