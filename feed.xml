* one-on-ones with Jennifer and James
* pair presentation with Chris
* job fair
* extracted another part of Zulip CSS
* played with Twine

I've started the day just right by having a wonderful one-on-one chat with Jennifer - a new experiment at RC that helps us get to know each other better. I admire her sense of direction and focus, and also love how Recursers share the need for growing and learning hard things.

V came up with a great idea of having pair presentations to talk about awesome projects some Recursers haven't presented yet. I've had a chance to pair with Chris on his [Citibike Routing App](http://chrissebesta.com/2016-10-19-citibikeroutingapp/) - a learning exercise in Angular 2 and Google Maps APIs. We've also discussed some possible tweaks and pairing opportunities based on the app. He was so passionate while explaining the &quot;mid-end&quot; concept of a backend on the front-end that I might just give Angular 2 another try.

Other awesome pairings for today were:

* Harold helped Andrea with presenting her [style transfer app](https://github.com/aheyman11/style-transfer-playground) for images
* Michelle talked about Andrew's [tools for making algorithmic art easier](https://github.com/ajyoon/blur)
* Mike explained neural networks after a crash course from Deniz
* Trey [personalized Hacker News](https://github.com/TreyLawrence/slackersnooze) and presented it with V
* Isabel and Isla used [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/image.html) to visualize genomic data

In the evening there was another job fair at RC. I wasn't particularly interested in any of the companies, as they didn't have remote opportunities, so I wanted to focus on helping other Recursers. There was nothing much for me to do, as most of them were engaged in conversations without any encouragement, so I turned to half-mingling, half-enjoying some unfocused time.

I am getting good at splitting the Zulip CSS. I've moved yet another large chunk of it to a new file and I can now plan more than a few steps ahead, understanding better how the refactoring could look and what other logical splits would be helpful. What started out as a tedious, but necessary, task became a great learning opportunity. It also supports other developers on the team, so I feel helpful while learning.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>I can’t get no motivation</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/2016/10/27/I-cant-get-no-motivation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I can't get no motivation" /><published>2016-10-27T02:58:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-27T02:58:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/2016/10/27/I-cant-get-no-motivation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/2016/10/27/I-cant-get-no-motivation.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve had those stashed in a “motivational” folder for quite some time and never got around to look at them, but maybe they’ll motivate someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

* extracted another part of Zulip CSS
* done some blog and website maintenance
* planned some fiction ideas
* played with Twine

Discovering which parts of Zulip CSS belong where is sometimes a mundane task, but it rewards my in better understanding of the app itself. I connect more and more dots every time I decide what part of the code to move, which will be beneficial with developing new features. A few more days and the CSS might be atomized enough to focus more on the refactoring itself.

I've also done some blog and website maintenance, mostly improving my workflow - some fresh bash aliases and reorganization of layouts and folders helped me with the growing content. I might need to write some Jekyll plugins to deal with specific tasks that seem repetitive, but at the moment I'm pretty happy with the work I've done so far.

While talking to friends at RC and back home, I came up with some new ideas for writing. I'm getting more and more excited about interactive fiction, since it seems simple enough to use it to build a game. One of my friends suggested Prolog and I might be inclined to go for it, but first I want to get better at writing the stories that are engaging and only then I can think of the implementation. That being said, I've spent some time playing with Twine and writing up some exercises from the book.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 72</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/26/RC-day-72.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 72" /><published>2016-10-26T03:23:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-26T03:23:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/26/RC-day-72</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/26/RC-day-72.html">Achievements:

* met the baby for the first time!
* had a great chat with Nancy
* had a fruitful talk with Leah
* had another Zulip pull request merged
* started playing with interactive fiction

First and foremost - I met my wonderful newest member of the family today! She was as observing me calmly and happily. I forgot how tiny little babies are.

I nearly got out of my sleep rut today, but the allergies kept me entertained most of the morning. The day started really late and I was worried I won't achieve most of my goals for today, but, amazingly, I did - [with a little help from my friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7OZNUVyec).

I've had a great chat with Nancy about next steps in my career and she agreed that Outreachy is a good way of getting the remote and full-time developer experience I need. I can also focus on helping other Recursers during the job fair on Thursday, since none of the companies that RSVPed have remote opportunities. I was thinking about asking all the hard questions nobody wants to ask a recruiter, since it won't be a risk for me.

Leah helped me a lot with rethinking my Outreachy application and suggested sensible changes to the narrative. Her insights were inspiring and I hope to introduce them over the weekend, to refactor it a little bit more before the final deadline.

I wanted to open a pull request that covers a lot of CSS atomization at once, but Tim suggested I should focus first on the parts that will be used in the upcoming redesigns of the app and merged my smaller PR today. I hope to finish all the other refactoring this week, so the files will be atomized enough to work on different parts of UI separately without worrying about changing (or breaking) other parts of the application.

I've also started on the book I bought yesterday and played with interactive fiction for two hours. I didn't think it would be so much fun, with a lot of dark humor involved. This might be the perfect start to longer forms for me, since I haven't written anything more than a short story in a few years. The only possible problem I see is translation, but as I will learn more about the tools and the process, I'll surely come up with a good way of dealing with that.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 71</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/26/RC-day-71.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 71" /><published>2016-10-26T03:15:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-26T03:15:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/26/RC-day-71</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/26/RC-day-71.html">Achievements:

* bought a book on interactive fiction
* worked on a prompt for muted streams in Zulip
* read awesome stories from other Recursers on reapplying

Today I was a bit scattered, since the slow weekend didn't help enough with drowsiness and allergies, so I focused on keeping the momentum going. I've worked on Zulip, mainly the prompt for muted streams and reading different parts of the documentation, but I didn't finish anything. In the evening I went for a long walk to Barnes &amp; Noble, because I couldn't get the [Writing Interactive Fiction with Twine](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Interactive-Fiction-Twine-Melissa/dp/0789756641) book out of my head and I bought it.

Other than that, I got a lot of inspiration from other Recursers discussing their process of reapplying to RC after being rejected at first (sometimes more than once). It shows that these awesome people are not only smart and talented, but also have a lot of perseverance and a mindset for growing. Someone suggested writing blog posts on that and that's a series I'd very much like to read.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 70</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/25/RC-day-70.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 70" /><published>2016-10-25T02:21:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-25T02:21:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/25/RC-day-70</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/25/RC-day-70.html">Achievements:

* binge-watched Black Mirror
* went on a wild run through Barnes &amp; Noble
* read up about interactive fiction for NaNoWriMo

[Black Mirror](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_Mirror) season 3 was released and with another allergy attack I figured the best way to spend Sunday night and morning was to binge watch it. If you've never seen it, it's a very dark series about dystopian futures - highly recommended, but requires a lot of mental stamina to go through.

I went to Barnes &amp; Noble, just because looking through books and knick-knocks I'm not going to buy puts me in a great mood. I've found a book on writing [interactive fiction](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Interactive_fiction) with [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and it seems like a pretty good idea for this year's [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/). I've never managed to actually complete the challenge before and an RPG setting might just convince me to do it properly this time.

* watched Rocky Horror Picture Show
* learned how webhooks work
* read up on Zulip and Beeminder APIs

I wanted to watch the new version of the classic [Rocky Horror Picture Show](http://www.rockyhorror.com/) with [Laverne Cox](http://www.lavernecox.com/) since I've heard about it and we've managed to have a movie night with some Recursers. It was wonderful, especially with live-singing by the more talented of us.

The day was cut short by my sleeping problems paired with a mild allergy attack, which meant I've only managed to learn something about webhooks and read up about Zulip and Beeminder APIs, for a possible integration. My work on some issues I wanted to finish soon didn't bring much in terms of results.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 68</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-68.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 68" /><published>2016-10-22T00:33:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-22T00:33:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-68</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-68.html">Achievements:

* algorithm prep
* reading a few essays in *Making Software*
* learning a lot about DDoS attacks
* working on some Zulip features

I wanted to be more productive today, but my cunning plan for fixing the sleep schedule didn't work and I've been more tired than usual. That being said, I've managed to have a good algorithm prep session with Andrew and Deniz, learning a lot from their problem solving skills and great feedback from Noah.

The Internet was down, or at least it seemed so. There was a massive [Distributed Denial of Service attack](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Denial-of-service_attack) on a DNS service Dyn, which caused a lot of confusion and seemed like a good reason to have a snow day. Dan saved the day (ruining my procrastination plans) by suggesting using [OpenDNS](https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/227987767-Dynamic-IP-Addresses-Technical-Detail-and-FAQ). I've ended up reading a lot about DDoS attacks and especially the role of the Internet of Things in the recent incident.

Other than that, I've read a few essays from a book Sumana recommended - [Making Software](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596808303.do) - and spent some time playing with Zulip features, at least one of which I want to finish by the end of the weekend.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 67</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-67.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 67" /><published>2016-10-22T00:05:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-22T00:05:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-67</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-67.html">Achievements:

* finished the blog post on the live coding session
* Abstract Salad Factory
* one-on-one with James
* took part in spelling bee
* job fair

In an attempt to fix my sleep schedule, I haven't slept all night and spent in writing drafts on various topics. I've finally finished my blog post on Sumana's [live coding session](https://trueskawka.github.io/blog/programming/2016/10/20/learning-by-observing.html), which I posted later in the day after approval from all parties involved.

I've made it on time for the Abstract Salad Factory, which is a healthy and social way to get  lunch. I've also had a good chat with James on my recent endeavors and am generally very happy with my recent results, although I've slowed down a bit in the last few days.

Instead of community presentations, we've had great fun with [programming spelling bee](https://gist.github.com/brilee/debf54541f419e1aacfad9e7a341b7f3) proposed by Brian. We coded in pairs, with our backs to the code and ping-ponging the program while saying a single character at a time. It was a lot like improv, since we've had to &quot;yes, and&quot; whatever the other person was saying and understanding what the other person meant was sometimes challenging. I've paired with Alicia, who is one of my superheroes.

After the spelling bee, we've had a job fair in the space, which was very different from my previous experience with such events. It was all about chatting with the companies in a non-stressful way. The space got a bit loud, but I've managed to talk to:

* [Harry's](https://www.harrys.com/) - a razor manufacturer and retailer, with a lot of big and furry problems coming with the vertical business model
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - a source of free online courses on multiple topics and areas, with the goal of providing free education to anyone, anytime
* [The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/) - an online career resource, fostering job opportunities and career advice, with a lot of interesting data science opportunities
* [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) - an investment management company heavily grounded in research and technology
* [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com/) - an agile tech consultancy, improving processes and building technology for their clients
* [UpLevel](https://www.uplevelsecurity.com/) - a small cybersecurity start-up

As I'm mostly interested in remote opportunities, Khan Academy and Reaktor seemed like the best options for me, although most of the companies I've talked to seem to be a pretty good cultural fit.</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 66</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-66.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 66" /><published>2016-10-22T00:05:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-22T00:05:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-66</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/22/RC-day-66.html">Achievements:

* watched the theoretical part of James's graph workshop
* worked on the live coding blog post
* planned my writing and did some creative housekeeping
* midnight check-out

James had another great workshop, this time on graphs. I chickened out of the exercises, but at least watched the theoretical part and read up about graph search algorithms.

The live coding blog post is taking more time than I expected, as I want to both keep as much of the spirit of the chat and introduce some non-intrusive remarks of my own. After a few hours of working on it, I've decided to do some creative housekeeping, by looking through my old writing and planning what to focus on next. It was also the main theme of my midnight checkout, which compared to the awesome work of Andy, Andrea and Andrew (no, we did not start the group because of the names only) wasn't much. Some days are not about big progress.

The cats at the new apartment are very demanding. There are three of them:

* a huge, fat ginger one who believes himself to be a tiny cute kitten I should pet all the time
* a tiny, constantly running around and very curious little girl
* a somewhat shy and very sweet black boy who hides under the table

Most of the nights I sleep at least partially covered with cats. It's definitely the best Airbnb experience so far, though due to my allergies my eyes are red like an albino rabbit's in the mornings.
