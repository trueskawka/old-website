  &lt;li&gt;deciding on next Zulip contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drafting the application for Outreachy at Zulip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drafting a presentation for non-technical talks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;signed-up for algorithm prep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;revamped my resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having some much needed rest, I’ve focused on planning and drafting my application for Outreachy. I’ve also created a short presentation on consolidated systems of preference relations for Tuesday’s non-technical talks, which may sound intimidating, but I hope to present it in a light and fun way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I’ve been working on my resume and expectations for next week’s job fairs. Since Outreachy deadline for applications is the upcoming Monday, I might just restrain from any other work. Especially since so much is happening at RC in the upcoming days - a meet-up at Etsy, interview prep, jobs profile building workshop, blog club, improv night and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Contra_dance&quot;&gt;contra dance&lt;/a&gt; evening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 58</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/12/RC-day-58.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 58" /><published>2016-10-12T19:01:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-12T19:01:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/12/RC-day-58</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/12/RC-day-58.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;submitted my pull request to Zulip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had two different American diner experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left RC at 10am today, after all night of coding and learning. I think my internal clock is completely broken by now and so is my ability to fall asleep in an instant, I’ve never cherished enough over the years. Instead of getting some much needed rest, I’ve tried and failed to watch the presidential debate and spent most of the first half of day napping between periods of reading random stuff on the Internet (some of which may be potentially useful in the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two days blurred into one long nap-counterpointed misc of programming and learning, with barely any socializing. Instead of going to RC in the afternoon, I met up with Cihan in a diner in Astoria. He pushed me into finishing my PR as-is, without worrying too much about it being perfect. Better early and flawed than perfect and late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn’t listen to him enough and was so paranoid about all tests passing all the time, I might’ve discovered a minor bug in the test suite, that made my local version of Zulip not pass the tests randomly. It turned out to be an issue unrelated to any of my changes and I’ve spend a few hours trying to figure it out and communicate the problem to Zulip team, which was a good learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ve submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/1983&quot;&gt;my PR&lt;/a&gt; around 4am, after checking and re-checking the code and accompanying messages for about three hours. I hope the more confident I get with open source, the less time I’ll spend on being terrified of wasting others’ time and more focused on the code quality, but I think the next few contributions are going to still be stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 24 hours I’ve tried two different American diners - one very stylish (priced accordingly) and one very American-movieish. Both were fun and I felt a bit like a movie-star (or at least a supporting character/innocent bystander in Pulp Fiction). Also, milkshakes. A girl needs to have more of those on bad days (which will be evened out in my diet by less and less bad days over time due to more milkshakes).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 57</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/12/RC-day-57.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 57" /><published>2016-10-12T17:31:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-12T17:31:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/12/RC-day-57</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/12/RC-day-57.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;snapped out of an impostor syndrome episode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned a lot about the codebase of Zulip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned even more about the development process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very hard to start working on my Outreachy application on Tuesday. The process of learning how Zulip works, where my PR fits in the codebase and how am I to contribute something meaningful to a big project a lot of people use, was time-consuming and a bit intimidating. At some point I felt I’m not going to achieve much and should just stop pretending, giving a way in for other, more focused, talented and generally smarter people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve realised I have a severe case of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Impostor_syndrome&quot;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and it was surprising for me. I got into RC - the programming Neverland, where everything is possible and failing is learning. Where people are self-motivated and curate a growth environment, that’s welcoming and non-intimidating. Even so, I’ve managed to convince myself subconsciously I don’t belong here. That I’ve wasted so much time over the years (especially other people’s time) and all my potential and learning is going to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much easier to talk and share things I feel confident about. My programming is going in the right direction, but it will take years for me to feel as confident as I am with my writing or business skills. And it might never even come to that, since the environment is constantly changing and the amount of learning required to stay on the top of my ability might be incomparable to most other settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a village to grow. I am lucky enough to have friends that care about me and know when I need a nudge in the right direction. Cihan was there again to intimidate me into working and we’ve work together all night. I didn’t finish the pull request, but I’ve learned a lot on the way and started feeling confident again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I think am at risk of being too much of a perfectionist, as ridiculous as it may sounds. I’m afraid of wasting someone’s time on a feature that’s not completely finished, so I’ll work on it more and try to push myself to share it by the end of the day on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 56</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/10/RC-day-56.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 56" /><published>2016-10-10T01:47:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-10T01:47:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/10/RC-day-56</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/10/RC-day-56.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;improv class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pairing with Cihan on merge sort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning how to properly use a profiler&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;half-watching the debate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NYC subway is sometimes an exercise in patience - what should take 45 minutes ends up sucking up 1.5h and there is no way to avoid it. Thankfully, as I don’t have that much time to read books at RC, I usually have a pretty good time catching up on my reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went for a free improv class at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magnettheater.com/&quot;&gt;Magnet Theater&lt;/a&gt; and it was an amazing experience. The “yes and” attitude is something everyone needs in their life. It’s all about being aware of other people and building on what they’ve created, while constantly having fun and laughs. I’ve read a lot about it today and am thinking about getting some more improv once I’m back home. I might write something more on the topic, but since it’s so hard to put in words at the moment (also - Outreachy deadline is approaching), here is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humorthatworks.com/learning/10-life-tips-from-improv-class/&quot;&gt;appetizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to watch the whole debate, but it was so repetitive and similar to everything I’ve already seen on the media, working on algorithms seemed like a better use of my time. Cihan was kind enough to pair with me on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Merge_sort&quot;&gt;merge sort&lt;/a&gt; problem for my algorithms course and I went through explaining the approach, implementing a quick solution with a horrible runtime of 35 seconds and improving it by using profiling to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/trueskawka/a4eab263a12cbec381ef8412b56b2d9a&quot;&gt;less than 2 seconds&lt;/a&gt;. I still want to skim through the debate, just to know what people are talking about, but it’s thankfully not among my priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 55</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/09/RC-day-55.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 55" /><published>2016-10-09T23:57:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-09T23:57:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/09/RC-day-55</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/09/RC-day-55.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;entrepreneurship workshop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;playing with algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dinner at a Polish Karczma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul’s entrepreneurship workshop took up most of the day - it ran from 10:30am to about 5:30pm, though I did move on to practice algorithms around 4:30pm, as I felt I’ve done nothing most of the day. Some small exercises and brain teasers helped me stay on the programming track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening Cihan, Joe and me went for dinner at a Polish restaurant in Greenpoint. It was nice to finally be the guide and I was pleasantly surprised by how much they both liked the food, especially the lard. After the long night of stuffing ourselves to the point of being barely able to move, I went to the apartment and slept for 10 hours straight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;interview prep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked on the pull request for Zulip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked on my writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the day: &lt;strong&gt;Eva’s and Shawn’s daughter was born!&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll be visiting them next week, to flood them with love and take a million photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, nothing much else happened. I’ve lead a session on conversational interview prep and also had an algorithmic one. It always amazes me, how differently people approach the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked on the pull request for Zulip, by playing with tests and checking what breaks. My writing is not yet ready to share, but some of the long-overdue posts may appear soon (don’t want to put a date on that, since Outreachy currently has priority).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also tried the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://ny.eater.com/2016/9/26/13060344/taiyaki-nyc-fish-cone-soft-serve&quot;&gt;soft-serve ice cream in fish-shaped cones&lt;/a&gt; (a Japanese treat called &lt;em&gt;taiyaki&lt;/em&gt;). The fish is a waffle filled with egg custard, which I could enjoy even without the ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I’ve found a new apartment near Canal St (about 20-minute walk from RC). This resulted in a happy dance on the newly created Victory Dance Platform (thanks to Deniz) - a square of the shared space to do a happy dance publicly. It’s a nice way to share your joy, but I’ll probably never do it again - there were a lot of people in the space and they started clapping the moment I’ve started dancing. Most terrifying experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;weekly check-in with a facilitator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check-out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;watched presentations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;met with Michael to talk about his feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coursework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this week’s experiments at RC, there is a lot happening in terms of accountability and sharing one’s work. I’ve had a long chat with James about my goals and concerns, followed by a check-out. Since I’ve started the day late, there wasn’t much to show apart from the working Zulip instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community presentations went great, my favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Joe and Cihan showed their app for Recursers for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rc-locos/rc-locos&quot;&gt;sharing their location&lt;/a&gt; - as it’s using RC authorization, I’m only sharing the repository here&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satabdi talked about debuggers and how to set breaking points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lyn presented a cute little app for learning statistical testing, using cute animated cubes, and talked about the implementation in Unity, using initial creature projects made in Blender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michelle had a hilarious talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Yuffster/toykb&quot;&gt;knowledge bases to support intrigue&lt;/a&gt;, using Hamlet (the play) as an example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After presentations I’ve had a fruitful chat with Michael about his Zulip feature. We’ve rebased his branch and talked about next steps for fixing some tests and adjusting behaviours. I hope to open my own pull request by the end of the weekend and have some time to focus on my second contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also done some relaxing algorithms coursework and will try to manage it in a repository by the end of this week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 52</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/06/RC-day-52.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 52" /><published>2016-10-06T02:05:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-06T02:05:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/06/RC-day-52</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/06/RC-day-52.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fixed my local Zulip instance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned more Vagrant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check-out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coursework on algorithms and effective thinking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;signed-up to facilitate interview prep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on my Outreachy application, I’ve managed to understand Vagrant better and fix my local Zulip instance with Cihan’s help. And when I say fix, I mean solve a problem that didn’t exist, since my codebase has not been updated to the latest version and there were some problems that shouldn’t be there. We’ve also managed to rebase Michael’s branch locally. And by rebasing I mean making it work with his changes while they’re not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the check-out I’ve talked mostly about redoing my RC jobs profile yesterday and problems with Vagrant. Comparing it to Brian’s and Jonathan’s work on their apps and Deniz’s progress with d3.js, I feel like it was an easy way out of the accountability of check-outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from struggles with making things work, reading up about new companies for Outreachy and preparing to facilitate interview prep (because, obviously, I feel ill-equipped to test other people on their programming skills), I’ve done some progress on the algorithms and effective thinking courses. As a good starting point for ideas to hopefully come, here are the five elements of effective thinking (which sound a lot like steps for learning anything):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understand deeply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. There are degrees to understanding and you can always heighten yours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;raise questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;follow ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;read up on Zulip documentation, roadmap and issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had a fruitful conversation with Sumana on Outreachy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up a meeting with Michael on his Zulip feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planned next steps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check-out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started a course in effective thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I work towards the Outreachy internship, I get more and more comfortable with thinking about the big projects and tackling them in small chunks. I’ve reread a big part of Zulip documentation, studied the roadmap and current issues, trying to figure out where my skills and expectations would fit best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumana is a knowledgable, skillful and amazing person. I’ve spent with her only 1.5 hours today and not only did she help me with my Outreachy ideas and priorities, pointing out some areas my skills could be best used for, but also gave a ton of inspiration on how to grow. I’ve been getting more and more inspired thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana&quot;&gt;Sumana’s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ballingt.com/&quot;&gt;Tom’s work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://moriel.smarterthanthat.com/tips/the-language-double-take-dealing-with-bidirectional-text-or-wait-tahw/&quot;&gt;Moriel’s take on RTL language support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that, given my experience and skills, building features for right-to-left language support and other internationalization aspects of apps sounds like a good project to focus on, while also remembering that I want to work on more than one area, since multiple goals are more likely to help me grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael, an RC alumnus, build a stream filtering feature for Zulip and I’m meeting with him on Thursday to understand it better and be able to work on it, as to merge it with the codebase. There is also an interesting feature for counting users following a stream and I’ll look into it tomorrow, to see what I’ll need help with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the next steps in the application process is to learn how to use Vagrant properly - at the moment I’m mostly running commands I don’t fully understand, which doesn’t help with troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second day of check-outs worked well. The group got a little big bigger, though considering the format a 25% increase is pretty substantial and I’d say 5 people is really the limit if it’s going to work as a method for improving accountability. The more people in the group, the less engaged they are and I think engagement is the key. Same as yesterday, others have done so much I’m motivated to do more for tomorrow’s meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to have some entertainment that doesn’t feel like wasting much time, I’ve started a course on &lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.9.10x+3T2016/&quot;&gt;Effective Thinking through Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. Improving analytical skills is always useful and I need a break from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the best quote I’ve stumbled upon today, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://rose.github.io/posts/measured-in-wats/&quot;&gt;Rose&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;knowledge is power - it’s measured in wats&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry><entry><title>RC - day 50</title><link href="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/03/RC-day-50.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RC - day 50" /><published>2016-10-03T23:57:31-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-03T23:57:31-04:00</updated><id>https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/03/RC-day-50</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://trueskawka.github.io/usa/rc/log/2016/10/03/RC-day-50.html">&lt;p&gt;Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had a chat about Outreachy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;implemented users in the Sinatra app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned something about the edit distance problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first check-out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new apartment is great, but I didn’t anticipate how long it would take to get to RC in the morning. I was late for my check-in and office hours for Outreachy at Zulip. Thankfully, I’ve managed to ask the questions I’ve needed answers for and decided what contribution to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve not worked much on Zulip today, as I paired with Michelle on Sinatra user authentication and managed to implement users in the to-do app, as a next step for learning how to build the main app. I’ve also learned how to solve the &lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/&quot;&gt;edit distance&lt;/a&gt; problem from Joe, though I haven’t implemented it myself yet, so that could be a good exercise sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also had my first check-out, best described as a check-in at the end of the day, but not as casual. Together with Deniz, Brian and Noah we discussed what we’ve done today and showed the actual code, which is the first time I’ve done it apart from pairing in a long time. Tomorrow we meet again at 6pm to review our progress, which is very motivating, considering how much they’ve all managed to do today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alicja</name></author><summary>Achievements:</summary></entry></feed>
