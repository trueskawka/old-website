After a quiet weekend at the RC, focusing today was much harder than expected. Thankfully, I already have some daily habits and starting the day with them helps me with unproductiveness and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
In terms of my main project, I haven't done much, but I'm planning to have a pairing session with Rose on Wednesday and do some research and work before that.
</p>
<p>
Gerald Sussman (the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT and Board Member of the Free Software Foundation) visited RC today and had a guest lecture on flexible systems in the evening. I must admit I haven't heard about him before RC. I admire his passion and skills, I think some people my age lack this kind of direction and focus.
</p>
<p>
As I didn't feel secure enough to say anything remotely interesting for him, I asked about his views on online education and some book recommendations for learning more about AI. I've also managed to ask a question after the lecture and got a pretty inspiring answer:
<blockquote>I want to enhance the lives of people who are having fun programming, not because it's a job they do, but because they want to think, and they want to learn by writing programs that help them think</blockquote>
<br />
I'm going to write more about the lecture itself later on, but I first need to wrap my mind around it.
