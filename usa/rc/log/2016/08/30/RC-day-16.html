<li>got to the RC before 7:30</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I couldn't sleep today so I got to the RC as soon as possible, since there is nothing much I could do at the apartment. In the morning the trains don't have so many delays and it's also not as hot, so it might be a good longterm strategy.
</p>
<p>
I finally evaluated how much uninterrupted time it takes before I am productive - breakfast, coffee, reading emails, checking social media and various news channels. I never thought it takes about 1.5 hours, which may explain why I always underestimate my workload. It's not that I need to be more efficient with it, just never thought about it much - after all, it's "just" a few things.
</p>
<p>
I'm pleased with my level of focus and productivity today. I've read a lot of algorithms books, done some coding, felt like I was going in the right direction to be a better programmer. The only downside was I needed a nap halfway through, as I'm not used to getting up so early. Maybe it's just how I'm supposed to work and I should take it into account over the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I went to the used books store and managed not to buy another book, which is something, seeing as it seems to be an addiction that runs in the family.
</p>
<p>
The evening was fun and inspiring, as I went to the Hack&amp;&amp;Tell meetup - a series of 5-minute presentations followed by 5-minute Q&amp;A sessions about projects people do in their free time for the pure fun of it. I came up with at least a dozen ideas on what I could do and I'll have to keep myself focused, but it was worth it. The presentations were:
<ul>
<li>virtual reality in JavaScript - <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/turing-incomplete/turing-incomtweet">automatisation of Twitter posts</a> for the <a href="http://turing.cool/">Turing incomplete</a> podcast</li>
<li>a new programming language called <a href="http://www.ziglang.org">Zig</a></li>
<li>useful and tiny website <a href="http://www.ismytrainfucked.com">ismytrainfucked.com</a></li>
<li>a game with Google ngrams dataset "Word Freq"</li>
<li><a href="http://boustro.com/app">an app</a> for <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Boustrophedon">buostrofying</a> text</li>
<li>a JavaScript application of spreadsheets called <a href="https://github.com/gmarceau/spread.js">spread.js</a></li>
<li>visualisation of NYC violations by precinct</li>
<li>simulation of the way colourblind see the world, to help designers create better products</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JonHMChan/descartes">Descartes</a> - CSS written in JS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I don't think I'll be able to not do any side projects, as I won a book - <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022657.do"><i>Kinect Hacks - Tips &amp; Tools for Motion and Pattern Detection</i></a>. I'm having some wild ideas about working with videos of Ginger.
