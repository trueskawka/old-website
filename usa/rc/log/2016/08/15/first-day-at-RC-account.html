    <p>The Recurse Center is a very welcoming and open place I'm going to spend 90% of my time at. Not just because it's what I came here to do, but also because I love it.</p>
<p>I've met a ton of people:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Joseph</b> from LA, who's into data science and bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Isla</b>, a mathematician from Scotland who's also into bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Paul</b> from Ireland, who has a PhD in compilers and runs his own business</li>
<li><b>Satabdi</b>, a Bengali girl who wants to work on her functional programming</li>
<li><b>Zach</b>, a programmer for RC who advised me on how to deal with cockroaches and actually considers them a NYC thing</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, an Australian who loves her JavaScript</li>
<li><b>Leah</b> of Bellevue, who wants to go through a statistics textbook</li>
<li><b>Trey</b> from California, who is in his second batch to have some time for himself between jobs</li>
<li><b>David</b>, who doesn't use his Korean name and wants to build an SMT-solver</li>
<li><b>Lisa</b>, a facilitator from Texas who loves her Android</li>
<li><b>Amy</b> Pickup, whose surname I love, wants to build web apps</li>
<li><b>Vaibhav</b>, an Indonesian guy who's into Haskell</li>
<li><b>Alicia</b>, in love with healthcare and Python</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> of Peru, who wants to play with Erlang and Elixir</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, who's done so many things I can't even imagine pair programming with her</li>
<li><b>Ivan</b>, a Russian who wants to experiment with data science, among a ton of other things</li>
<li><b>Miguel</b>, another Haskell enthusiast from Colombia</li>
<li><b>Katherine</b>, a biologist who loves her Python and Vim</li>
<li><b>Lareine</b> from New Jersey, a very shy girl who has a lot to offer, especially with Arduino</li>
<li><b>Leeor</b> from Israel, a lawyer who turned to coding</li>
<li><b>Ivo</b>, a quiet web-dev from Lima</li>
<li><b>James</b>, a backend programmer turned RC facilitator from NY</li>
<li><b>?</b> from Mid-West, an geologist who does web dev and digs data science</li>
<li><b>Sean</b>, a graduate student in linguistics and language perception</li>
<li><b>Ginger</b>, a mix of a maltese and a poodle (maltipoo), who's just the cutest dog ever</li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the people I've talked (or played with in case of Ginger) at least for a few minutes. Altogether I've met about thrice as much.</p>
<p>On one hand, the first day was relaxing. We did introductions, first check-ins, lunch, developer speed-dating, some quiet time and a meetup.</p>
<p>On the other, reiterating my story with new people every few minutes was exhausting. I'm not sure I even know what I've said to most of them. Loads of new ideas, but also insecurity, as I don't know where to start.</p>
