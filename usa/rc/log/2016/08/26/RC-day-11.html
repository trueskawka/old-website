<p>
This was the most intense day at RC so far. From the check-in at 10:30am until the end of presentations at 6:30pm I've had only two short breaks.
</p>
<h4>NLP workshop</h4>
<p>
The NLP workshop was more theoretical than I expected, focusing on efficient way to represent probabilities. I'd love to get to the nitty-gritty of the implementation for parts of speech tagging, but it was still quite a useful setup for thinking about language processing.
</p>
<h4>Code retreat</h4>
<p>
For the code retreat we did pair-programmed, test-driven Game of Life in four runs. My coding partners were (I guess "J" was the letter of the day):
<ul>
<li><b>Jade</b> for the initial Python look at the problem, with extremely detailed unit tests, which was a great starting point,</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> for a little bit more broad approach to it in Ruby, which taught me a lot about best practices in a very short time,</li>
<li><b>James</b> for the second try in Python, this time trying it with sub-matrices and using the "neighbourhood" of a cell as a starting point,</li>
<li><b>Juliano</b> for some playtime with Elixir - we've had a great time pairing earlier this week, but today we were both way too tired to implement the problem or even recognise syntax problems.</li>
</ul>
The approach for the exercise was doing it test-first and throwing away the code after a pairing session. The rules for each one were:
<ul>
<li>ping-pong TDD - one person writes the test, the other one implementation and the next test, then the first one has to implement etc.,</li>
<li>3 line limit on methods,</li>
<li>no primitive data types (focusing on expressing in problem domain terms),</li>
<li>no conditional statements/no speaking (the second one could've been used as an additional constraint for some languages, as it's sometimes natural to not use conditional statements).</li>
</ul>
I would love to write more about the code retreat, but I feel I need a few days to think about all the benefits of it and reevaluate my strategy before the next one (because, obviously, there has to be a next one).
</p>
<h4>Goal-setting workshop</h4>
<p>
The goal-setting workshop was a surprisingly successful short exercise. We worked in groups of three, working on one person's goals at a time. First they would present their focus for the RC, achievements to date and possible problems that are holding them back. Then the other members of the group would discuss it briefly without the involvement of the presenter and at the end of focus mini-session they'd have some time to reflect on the insights.
</p>
<p>
I was pleasantly surprised how optimistic <b>David</b> and <b>Sofia-Jeanne</b> were about my goals and focus. The cute thing we did at the end of the workshop were paper cranes with our goals hidden inside, so we can unfold them at the end of our batch.
</p>
<p>
During the workshop we were also introduced to the concept of Test Driven Learning, which I think deserves a separate blog post as soon as I find some time.
</p>
<h4>Presentations</h4>
<p>
Presentations today were awesome (as usual), the ones I especially liked were:
<ul>
<li><b>Loraine's</b> approach to ethical engineering of self-driving cars (hilarious in a bit disturbing way)</li>
<li><b>James's</b> summary of the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fast_inverse_square_root">fast inverse square root</a> problem</li>
<li><b>Michelle's</b> cute little JS app I don't think she gave herself enough credit for</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
After so many adventures I went for a huge poke bowl with <b>Juliano</b> to a very nice place called Simple (some photos below).
