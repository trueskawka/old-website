              <h3>second day at RC</h3>

                <p>
Achievements:
<ul>
<li>using Aeropress for the first time</li>
<li>having a meaningful check-in</li>
<li>doing Warmups</li>
<li>having a first one-on-one to get me started on the right track</li>
<li>code dojo - pair programming in Ruby</li>
<li>figuring out my workflow with Zulip</li>
<li>finding a cheap and good Vietnamese place for lunch</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It is very easy to get distracted at the RC. Everybody is doing something new and exciting, many people are feeling overwhelmed.
The first day was mostly about getting around the space, whilst the second is about settling and being more comfortable. Knowing where you're going for lunch or how to use the coffee grinder. Getting into the rhythm of morning check-ins, warmups and daily pair programming.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow I'm planning for more alone time, as I'm finally out of the rut and have some ideas on the first steps for my big project.

<ul>
<li>you can't escape the heat in the subway - the stations are hotter and more humid and one can wait for a train up to 30-40 minutes</li>
<li>subway trains are really cold and you can't hear the announcements, unless it's 11pm, when the drivers suddenly know how to use the intercom and shout</li>
<li>the city never sleeps, at least not before midnight - stores, even tiny ones, are open, people are sitting on the stairs talking or walking around (I can understand socialising late, when temperature drops to manageable 25 degrees)</li>
<li>a broken water pipe is the source of joy for the entire neighbourhood, children and adults alike run around in the water and nobody even thinks about calling someone to fix it</li>
<li>shopping is a bit confusing, since they use net prices and I'm never quite sure what products are taxed, thus how much am I supposed to pay</li>
<li>they have paypass, but don't know what it is and how to use it</li>
<li>street lights have a countdown, which was a bit stressful at first as I couldn't see the numbers and believed crossing should take about 5 seconds - that got solved with jaywalking</li>

              </div>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>The Recurse Center is a very welcoming and open place I'm going to spend 90% of my time at. Not just because it's what I came here to do, but also because I love it.</p>
<p>I've met a ton of people:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Joseph</b> from LA, who's into data science and bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Isla</b>, a mathematician from Scotland who's also into bioinformatics</li>
<li><b>Paul</b> from Ireland, who has a PhD in compilers and runs his own business</li>
<li><b>Satabdi</b>, a Bengali girl who wants to work on her functional programming</li>
<li><b>Zach</b>, a programmer for RC who advised me on how to deal with cockroaches and actually considers them a NYC thing</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, an Australian who loves her JavaScript</li>
<li><b>Leah</b> of Bellevue, who wants to go through a statistics textbook</li>
<li><b>Trey</b> from California, who is in his second batch to have some time for himself between jobs</li>
<li><b>David</b>, who doesn't use his Korean name and wants to build an SMT-solver</li>
<li><b>Lisa</b>, a facilitator from Texas who loves her Android</li>
<li><b>Amy</b> Pickup, whose surname I love, wants to build web apps</li>
<li><b>Vaibhav</b>, a Hindu guy who's into Haskell</li>
<li><b>Alicia</b>, in love with healthcare and Python</li>
<li><b>Juan</b> of Peru, who wants to play with Erlang and Elixir</li>
<li><b>Michelle</b>, who's done so many things I can't even imagine pair programming with her</li>
<li><b>Ivan</b>, a Russian who wants to experiment with data science, among a ton of other things</li>
<li><b>Miguel</b>, another Haskell enthusiast from Colombia</li>
<li><b>Katherine</b>, a biologist who loves her Python and Vim</li>
<li><b>Lareine</b> from New Jersey, a very shy girl who has a lot to offer, especially with Arduino</li>
<li><b>Leeor</b> from Israel, a lawyer who turned to coding</li>
<li><b>Ivo</b>, a quiet web-dev from Lima</li>
<li><b>James</b>, a backend programmer turned RC facilitator from NY</li>
<li><b>?</b> from Mid-West, an geologist who does web dev and digs data science</li>
<li><b>Sean</b>, a graduate student in linguistics and language perception</li>
<li><b>Ginger</b>, a mix of a maltese and a poodle (maltipoo), who's just the cutest dog ever</li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the people I've talked (or played with in case of Ginger) at least for a few minutes. Altogether I've met about thrice as much.</p>
<p>On one hand, the first day was relaxing. We did introductions, first check-ins, lunch, developer speed-dating, some quiet time and a meetup.</p>
<p>On the other, reiterating my story with new people every few minutes was exhausting. I'm not sure I even know what I've said to most of them. Loads of new ideas, but also insecurity, as I don't know where to start.</p>

                <p>That's what my host told me when I complained about a cockroach infestation at the apartment.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was two small insects, one in the kitchen sink and the other one in my closet.</p>
<p>Today morning it was three of them in the sink and one in the bathroom. I've had the pleasure of filming his movements to document the encounter.</p>
<p>Now I'm afraid of looking into a drawer, since I've just met the new inhabitant - a huge roach nearly the size of my thumb.</p>
<p>I've contacted Airbnb, just to make sure I'll be eligible for a full refund. I've asked the host to get rid of the infestation, since I don't believe 7 cockroaches in the span of 24 hours count as a "problem that occurs very rarely".</p>
<p>It will be a bummer to leave the AC behind.</p>

<p>Eva and Shawn are great. They've shown me around and are making sure I'm comfortable and taken care of. They're like a family abroad.</p>
<p>Upper Manhattan reminds me of London - brick buildings, loads of local shops and loads of parks. It's also really dense and varied. Walking two blocks down takes you to a very different area.</p>
<p>The heat melts away any thoughts of walking around before evening, so I guess it'll be a quiet first day in and a late walk to find the RC.</p>
