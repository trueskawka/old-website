                <p>I'm still not sure what time it is, I'm floating somewhere between noon and 2pm.</p>
<p>Eva and Shawn are great. They've shown me around and are making sure I'm comfortable and taken care of. They're like a family abroad.</p>
<p>Upper Manhattan reminds me of London - brick buildings, loads of local shops and loads of parks. It's also really dense and varied. Walking two blocks down takes you to a very different area.</p>
<p>The heat melts away any thoughts of walking around before evening, so I guess it'll be a quiet first day in and a late walk to find the RC.</p>
