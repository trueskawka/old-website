<ul>
<li>you can't escape the heat in the subway - the stations are hotter and more humid and one can wait for a train up to 30-40 minutes</li>
<li>subway trains are really cold and you can't hear the announcements, unless it's 11pm, when the drivers suddenly know how to use the intercom and shout</li>
<li>the city never sleeps, at least not before midnight - stores, even tiny ones, are open, people are sitting on the stairs talking or walking around (I can understand socialising late, when temperature drops to manageable 25 degrees)</li>
<li>a broken water pipe is the source of joy for the entire neighbourhood, children and adults alike run around in the water and nobody even thinks about calling someone to fix it</li>
<li>shopping is a bit confusing, since they use net prices and I'm never quite sure what products are taxed, thus how much am I supposed to pay</li>
<li>they have paypass, but don't know what it is and how to use it</li>
<li>street lights have a countdown, which was a bit stressful at first as I couldn't see the numbers and believed crossing should take about 5 seconds - that got solved with jaywalking</li>
</ul>
