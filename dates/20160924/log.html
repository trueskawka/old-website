      Achievements:

* got a lot of rest
* reflected on my first six weeks at RC
* discovered my patronus

Six weeks ago I came to NYC with a very vague idea of what I wanted to do specifically. There seemed to be so many things I wanted and 'had' to learn - algorithms, networking, CS, 'proper' programming (whatever that means), machine learning, better visualisations, APIs, audio processing etc. The list could go on and on, as for the first few days I was utterly distracted and lost.

Over the course of the first half of my batch, I've tried and resigned from many things. I didn't work enough on my 'big' project, I felt that some methods of learning or topics I wanted to learn do not resonate with me. I've been going to workshops, sometimes a few a day, trying to learn as much as possible. At the same time, I was constantly amazed by the degree of focus of some of my fellow batchers, especially those who came here for 'only' six weeks.

The health scare last week was a wake-up call - I've been overworking myself, overdosing on the wonderful experience that is RC. Yes, it was great to get up every morning full of plans and with my to-do list bursting. To rush for my morning meditation and check-in, feeling like I'm moving forward. But I need to shift my focus and adjust my goals, otherwise I might lose my motivation altogether. After all, it's all about never graduating.

As such, I have a few areas and goals to focus on, distilled from the vast universe of possibilities:

* I still want to build my language-learning app, a project I've spread into tiny tasks that are now somewhere near the end of my to-do list under an avalanche of ideas

* I love talking to people and I've been doing a lot of that, but I want to talk more about programming, which means more pairing - at least part of it should be focused on pursuing my projects

* shortlist of bigger projects:
  * language-learning app (possible pairing on audio processing, APIs and web dev)
  * learning React while building an app (I have some ideas I would like to work on, especially with Ivo)
  * building my own Markdown editor, either web or for MacOS

* career goals:
  * writing 10 professional blog posts by the end of my stay in the US
  * applying for the remote opportunity I'm excited about (but don't want to write about it too much, as not to jinx it)
  * having at least 2 interview prep sessions a week

* productive procrastination:
  * an ongoing list of shorter projects to learn specific programming skills
  * making small 3D printed prototypes for future DYIing

* 5 hours a week for a non-programming learning project

* spending Sundays and most of Saturdays on sightseeing/socializing

All in all, the first half of my batch was a perspective-changing experience. I'll work on the next six weeks to be even better.

Other than reflections, plans and rest, I've had a fun few minutes with discovering [my patronus on Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/news/discover-your-patronus-on-pottermore). Apparently it's a weasel, which doesn't seem too far removed from a squirrel I've always imagined it to be.

      Achievements:

* planned a mob coding session with James
* had a great algorithms prep with Taylor
* took part in Mike's Internet protocols workshop
* tweaked my setup
* played board games

Started the day perfectly with Sean's scones, I've had a productive short session with James on the mob coding for the new batch on Monday. We'll try to code a working Hangman implementation in Python in 45 minutes.

My first algorithms prep was great, I don't think I could've had a better partner for that than Taylor. I worked on a fairly simple matrix problem first, with some helpful feedback from Taylor, and then he got to work on a simple-turned-complicated brain teaser. I will definitely try to have more prep over the next 6 weeks and with more challenging questions.

Mike's Internet protocols workshop (alternatively known as sniffing the glue that holds the Internet together) was comprehensive and helpful. I look forward to the next 5 or so sessions ahead of us. Mike is a great teacher! He managed to make a not so interesting topic fascinating, with a lot of examples of real-world usage and further steps for learning.

Other than that I tweaked my setup a little bit, since some fellow Recursers had problems with reading my syntax highlighting during pairing. Too be fair, the tiny-tiny letters on my screen are not of much help either, but since there is a simple enough shortcut for that, I'm not going to change it just yet. My bash prompt welcomes me now with a little heart.

We stayed quite late at the RC, playing board games and solving problems in our apps (but mostly board games). I love the space so much, I sometimes wish I could just not sleep at all.

      Achievements:

* worked with Jeni, Alicia and Satabdi on the sexism tracking app
* Abstract Salad Factory
* MCed presentations
* had fun at the farewell picnic
* walked through the Brooklyn Bridge

The productive part of the day was really short, since today we had a farewell picnic for the Summer 2 batch (who overlapped with us) and some of our fellow batchers from Fall 1, who came here only for six weeks.

I've managed to get some coding started on our sexism tracking app, pairing with Jeni on views. The Abstract Salad Factory helped me then with not feeling guilty about indulging myself during the presentations and the picnic.

I volunteered to MC the presentations, i.e. being the master of ceremonies - introducing speakers and making sure everything works out. It was fun, albeit a bit stressful. I had to come up to every person that was presenting, interrupt their last touchups and make sure their laptops work with the projector, the loudspeakers won't make everybody's ears bleed and they have whatever they might need. Even though I've had a few missteps on the way, everything ran pretty smoothly.

Presentations themselves were hilarious, some of my favourites were:

* Lareine's implementation of ethical engineering algorithm, with some surprising turns on who "deserves" to live - [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8yd8d0ynkw25oxx/Ethical%20Engineering.pptx) are some of her thoughts from the previous presentation
* Jesse's [DJ app](https://github.com/JesseRap/RoboDJ), on which he worked together with Taylor - it automatically mixes music, just as a DJ would
* Michelle's [intranationalization engine for Markdown](http://i17on.com/), which she hilariously presented with examples of possible uses of filtering words in text (e.g. you might want your resume to be "tech" for some people, but "fun" for others)
* Juan's [CHIP-8](https://github.com/jhbabon/johnny_eight) emulator, which he got to play pong!

We went to the Brooklyn Bridge park and had a few wonderful hours in the sun, eating snacks and playing some outdoor sports. I learned to throw the egghand (Americans would call it football), but I need to work on not getting hit in the face with it. Also, a squirrel was very into our cookies and she was very impatient.

I've also tried an American burger for the very first time and the experience was a bit disturbing - it tasted like something twice deep-fried. Striving to have more NYC experiences, I went on a walk through Brooklyn Bridge, or rather was dragged through it with the help of Cihan and Joe. It is ver high and the sidewalk is made of wood, my fear of heights won't let me forget about it.
